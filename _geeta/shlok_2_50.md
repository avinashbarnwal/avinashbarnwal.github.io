The Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2, Verse 50 (2.50), addresses the concept of skillful action through the practice of yoga, emphasizing detachment and mindfulness. Here’s the Sanskrit verse and its meaning:

Sanskrit:
योगः कर्मसु कौशलम्।
(Yogaḥ karmasu kauśalam.)

Translation:
Yoga is skill in action.

Explanation:
In this verse, Krishna teaches that yoga is not just physical postures or meditation but involves excellence in performing one’s duties with equanimity. It implies acting with:

Detachment: Performing one’s work without being overly attached to the outcomes.
Mindfulness: Being fully present and focused on the task at hand.
Efficiency: Taking action with wisdom, balance, and an understanding of dharma (one’s duty).
By cultivating such an attitude, one avoids being swayed by success or failure and achieves liberation through their actions. This principle is foundational to Karma Yoga, the path of selfless action.
