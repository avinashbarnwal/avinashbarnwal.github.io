📜 Transliteration (English letters)

yato yato niścharati
manaś chañchalam asthiram
tatas tato niyamya etad
ātmani eva vaśaṁ nayet

🌟 Translation (Simple English)

Wherever and whenever the unsteady and restless mind wanders away, one should gently bring it back and place it under the control of the Self.

🧠 Meaning / Explanation

The mind is naturally restless, unstable, and easily distracted.

During meditation or focus, thoughts will wander — this is normal.

Krishna tells Arjuna: Don’t get frustrated. Don't force or fight the mind harshly.

Instead, again and again, gently guide it back to awareness of the Self (Ātman / inner consciousness).

This is the core of mind discipline and meditation practice.

💡 Essence in One Line

True meditation is not the absence of thoughts —
It is the continuous effort to bring the mind back whenever it slips away.
