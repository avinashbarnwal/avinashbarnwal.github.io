English Translation:

Verse Breakdown:
This verse lists various types of people we encounter in life:
Suhr̥t (सुखृत्) – One who wishes you well, selflessly
Mitra (मित्र) – A friend or ally
Ari (अरि) – An enemy
Udāsīna (उदासीन) – One who is indifferent or neutral
Madhyastha (मध्यस्थ) – A mediator or arbitrator
Dveṣya (द्वेष्य) – One who hates you
Bandhu (बन्धु) – A relative
Sādhu (साधु) – The righteous
Pāpi (पापि) – The sinner

Key Concept: समबुद्धिः (Sama-buddhiḥ) – Equanimity of Mind
Lord Krishna explains that the true yogi, the one who excels, is not swayed by external relations or others' behavior. Whether someone loves or hates them, helps or harms them, the yogi remains even-minded, free from attachment or aversion.
This equal vision stems from understanding that all beings are expressions of the same Divine Self. This doesn’t mean the yogi loses discernment — rather, he transcends emotional bias and stays spiritually grounded.

Essence of the Verse:
True yoga is not just about sitting in meditation — it's about how you see and treat others.
The yogi who remains unbiased, calm, and loving toward all, regardless of their role or conduct, is considered spiritually advanced.
