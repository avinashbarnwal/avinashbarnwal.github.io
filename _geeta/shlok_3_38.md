Bhagavad Gita – Chapter 3, Shloka 38 (3.38)

Sanskrit:

धूमेनाव्रियते वह्निर्यथाऽऽदर्शो मलेन च |
यथोल्बेनावृतो गर्भस्तथा तेनेदमावृतम् || 3.38 ||

Transliteration:

dhoomenaavriyate vahnir yathaadarsho malena cha
yatholbenaavrito garbhas tathaa tenedam aavritam

Translation:
Just as fire is covered by smoke, a mirror by dust, and an embryo by the womb, similarly, knowledge is covered by desire, O Arjuna.

Summary:
This verse gives three metaphors to explain how desire hides true wisdom:
Like smoke covering fire (thin layer, easy to remove),
Like dust on a mirror (requires effort to clean),
Like a fetus in the womb (deeply covered, takes time to emerge).

Desire clouds our inner wisdom and disconnects us from our true self. The stronger the desire, the harder it becomes to see clearly.
