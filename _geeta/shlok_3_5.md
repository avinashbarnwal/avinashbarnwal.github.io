**Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 3, Verse 5 (Shloka 3.5):**

"Na hi kaścit kṣaṇam api jātu tiṣṭhaty akarma-kṛt।          
Kāryate hy avaśaḥ karma sarvaḥ prakṛti-jair guṇaiḥ॥"       

**Translation:**       
Indeed, no one can remain without performing action even for a moment. Everyone is helplessly driven to act by the qualities born of material nature (Prakriti).

**Explanation:**     
This verse emphasizes the inevitability of action in human life. It highlights that even when one appears inactive, the forces of nature (gunas) continuously influence thoughts, emotions, and bodily processes, compelling action. Therefore, true renunciation is not abandoning action but acting selflessly and with detachment from results.
