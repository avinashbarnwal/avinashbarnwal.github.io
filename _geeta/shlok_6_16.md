Here is Bhagavad Gita Chapter 6, Shloka 16 (6.16):

Sanskrit (IAST):
nātyaśnatastu yogo ’sti na caikāntam anśnataḥ
na cāti-svapna-śīlasya jāgrato naiva cārjuna

Translation (Literal):
Yoga is not possible, Arjuna, for one who eats too much, nor for one who does not eat at all;
Not for one who sleeps excessively, nor for one who is sleepless.

Explanation

In this verse, Lord Krishna emphasizes balance and moderation as essential for a yogi (a spiritual practitioner):

Not too much eating / not fasting entirely – Excess indulgence makes the body heavy and dull, while extreme austerity weakens it. Both are obstacles to meditation.

Not too much sleep / not sleeplessness – Over-sleeping leads to laziness, while lack of rest causes mental agitation.

The key idea is moderation in lifestyle – yoga flourishes when the body and mind are kept steady, disciplined, and balanced.
