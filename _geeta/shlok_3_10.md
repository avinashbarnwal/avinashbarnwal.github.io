Saha-yajñāḥ prajāḥ sṛṣṭvā purovāca prajāpatiḥ।        
Anena prasaviṣyadhvam eṣa vo'stv iṣṭa-kāma-dhuk॥        

**Translation:**        
At the beginning of creation, the Creator (Prajapati) created humans along with sacrifices (yajña) and said: "By this (sacrifice), may you prosper; let this be the cow of plenty (kāmadhuk) that grants all your desires."

This verse emphasizes the concept of yajña (sacrifice) as an integral part of human existence and prosperity. It highlights that selfless actions and offerings maintain harmony between humans and nature. Through sacrifices, humanity can ensure growth, fulfillment of desires, and spiritual progress. It also implies that humans should act in service to others and the divine for mutual prosperity and sustainability.
