**The Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 3, Shloka 28 (3.28) states:**

प्रकृतेः क्रियमाणानि गुणैः कर्माणि सर्वशः।      
अहङ्कारविमूढात्मा कर्ताहमिति मन्यते॥      

**Transliteration:**      
Prakṛiteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ,           
ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā kartāham iti manyate.                  

**Meaning:**           
All actions are actually performed by the three modes of material nature (sattva, rajas, and tamas), but a person who is deluded by false ego considers himself to be the doer.

**Explanation:**           
This verse emphasizes the concept that all activities are driven by Prakriti (nature) through the three gunas (modes of nature).
However, a person with false ego (ahaṅkāra) mistakenly believes that they are the sole doer of actions.
A wise person understands that actions are governed by nature and cosmic laws, rather than personal ego.
This shloka teaches detachment and self-awareness, urging individuals to recognize the role of divine forces and nature in life’s actions rather than being consumed by ego and the illusion of control.
