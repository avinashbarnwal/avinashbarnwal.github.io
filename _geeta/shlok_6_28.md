भगवद् गीता 6.28 — Shloka, Meaning & Essence
Sanskrit    
युञ्जन्नेवं सदात्मानं योगी विगतकल्मषः ।     
सुखेन ब्रह्मसंस्पर्शमत्यन्तं सुखमश्नुते ॥ ६.२८ ॥      

Transliteration        
yuñjann evaṁ sadātmānaṁ yogī vigatakalmaṣaḥ     
sukhena brahma-saṁsparśam atyantaṁ sukham aśnute       

Translation (Simple & Clear)      
A yogi who constantly disciplines and aligns his mind,      
and becomes free from all impurities,      
effortlessly experiences the supreme joy       
that arises from union with Brahman.       

Deep Meaning (Short Explanation)      
- When the mind is trained (steady, disciplined, non-reactive),     
- and the inner impurities (fear, anger, ego, restlessness) fade away,      

the yogi naturally touches Brahma-samsparsha —       
the direct experience of the divine, the pure consciousness inside.         

This experience is not temporary pleasure;     
it is atyantam sukham — a joy that is unbroken, effortless, and self-existing.     

Krishna is saying:      
Real happiness doesn’t come from the world, it emerges when the mind becomes still enough to touch its own source.    

One-Line Essence      
When the mind becomes pure and steady, bliss becomes natural — not achieved, but revealed.
