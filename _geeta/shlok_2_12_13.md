**Here are verses 2.12 and 2.13 from the Bhagavad Gita:**

**Bhagavad Gita 2.12:**

na tvevāhaṁ jātu nāsaṁ na tvaṁ neme janādhipāḥ,
na caiva na bhaviṣyāmaḥ sarve vayam ataḥ param

**Translation: **

"Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to be."


**Bhagavad Gita 2.13:**
dehino ’smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā,
tathā dehāntara-prāptir dhīras tatra na muhyati

**Translation: **

"Just as the embodied soul continuously passes, in this body, from childhood to youth to old age, similarly, the soul passes into another body at death. The wise are not deluded by this."


These verses highlight the eternal nature of the soul, emphasizing that it does not perish with the body but undergoes a continuous journey beyond life and death.
