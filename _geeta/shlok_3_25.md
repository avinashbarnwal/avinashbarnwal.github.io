**Bhagavad Gita 3.25 (Chapter 3, Verse 25)**

सक्ताः कर्मण्यविद्वांसो यथा कुर्वन्ति भारत।     
कुर्याद्विद्वांस्तथासक्तश्चिकीर्षुर्लोकसंग्रहम्॥ २५॥      

**Transliteration:**      
Saktāḥ karmaṇy-avidvāṁso yathā kurvanti bhārata,                 
Kuryād-vidvāṁs tathāsaktaś chikīrṣur loka-saṅgraham.                       

**Translation:**                      
"O Bharata (Arjuna), just as the ignorant act with attachment to work, so should the wise act without attachment, desiring the welfare of the world."

**Explanation:**                 
This verse emphasizes the responsibility of the wise (learned or enlightened) to engage in action selflessly. While ignorant individuals work with attachment to the results, the wise should continue performing their duties, but without attachment, in order to set an example and contribute to the well-being of society (loka-sangraha).

This aligns with the concept of karma yoga (the path of selfless action), where one should work diligently without being bound by desires or personal gain.
