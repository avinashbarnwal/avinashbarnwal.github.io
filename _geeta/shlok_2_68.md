**The verse Bhagavad Gita 2.68 (Chapter 2, Verse 68) emphasizes the importance of controlling one's senses to achieve spiritual discipline and peace.**

Here's the Sanskrit verse along with its transliteration and meaning:         
**Sanskrit:**       
तस्माद् यस्य महाबाहो निगृहीतानि सर्वशः।
इन्द्रियाणीन्द्रियार्थेभ्यस्तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिता।।

**Transliteration:**       
Tasmād yasya mahābāho nigṛhītāni sarvaśaḥ         
indriyāṇīndriyārthebhyas tasya prajñā pratiṣṭhitā.               

**Meaning:**         
Therefore, O mighty-armed (Arjuna), one whose senses are completely restrained from their objects, his wisdom is firmly established.            

**Explanation:**      
This verse highlights the practice of self-control. It advises that to remain steadfast in wisdom and achieve true knowledge, one must withdraw their senses from the objects of desire, just as a tortoise withdraws its limbs into its shell (a reference to an earlier verse, 2.58). The control over senses leads to stability of mind, which is essential for spiritual growth.
