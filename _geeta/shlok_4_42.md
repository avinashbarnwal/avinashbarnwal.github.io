Explanation:
In this verse, Lord Krishna is addressing Arjuna (referred to as "Bharata," from the lineage of Bharata). He tells Arjuna to overcome the doubts in his mind, which have emerged from ignorance. These doubts have taken root in his heart and are preventing him from fulfilling his duty. Krishna advises Arjuna to use the sword of knowledge (discrimination between the eternal and the non-eternal) to destroy those doubts.
The "yoga" here refers to the disciplined action, aligning oneself with one's higher purpose, through which one can overcome confusion and inner turmoil. Krishna encourages Arjuna to rise above these doubts, take refuge in yoga, and move forward with confidence.
In essence, the verse emphasizes the importance of using wisdom and knowledge to dispel ignorance and hesitation, and to act with clarity and purpose.
