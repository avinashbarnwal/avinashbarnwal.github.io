**Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2, Verse 49 (2.49) is as follows:**      

**Sanskrit:**       
दूरेण ह्यवरं कर्म बुद्धियोगाद्धनञ्जय।
बुद्धौ शरणमन्विच्छ कृपणाः फलहेतवः॥

**Transliteration:**      
Dūreṇa hyavaraṁ karma buddhiyogād dhanañjaya,
Buddhau śaraṇam anviccha kṛpaṇāḥ phalahetavaḥ.

**Translation:**     
"O Dhananjaya (Arjuna), action performed with a selfish motive is far inferior to the disciplined action done with the wisdom of equanimity. Seek refuge in this wisdom. Those who work for the fruits of their actions are miserable."

**Key Insights:**    
**Selfless Action:** Krishna emphasizes the superiority of actions performed with wisdom and detachment over actions driven by selfish desires.
**Equanimity:** Acting with equanimity helps one rise above the bondage of success and failure, leading to inner peace.
**Avoiding Misery:** Attachment to the results of actions causes suffering; freedom lies in selfless action.
This verse urges Arjuna (and all of us) to adopt the path of selfless duty (Karma Yoga) combined with the wisdom of detachment (Buddhi Yoga).
