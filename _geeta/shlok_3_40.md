**Bhagavad Gita Chapter 3, Shloka 40 (गीता श्लोक 3.40) is as follows:**    

**Sanskrit:**    
इन्द्रियाणि मनो बुद्धिरस्याधिष्ठानमुच्यते।
एतैर्विमोहयत्येष ज्ञानमावृत्य देहिनम्॥ ४०॥

**Transliteration:**     
Indriyāṇi mano buddhir asyādhiṣṭhānam ucyate,
etair vimohayaty eṣa jñānam āvṛtya dehinam.

Word-by-Word Meaning:
Indriyāṇi — the senses
Manaḥ — the mind
Buddhiḥ — the intellect
Asya — of this (desire/lust)
Adhiṣṭhānam — seat, abode
Ucyate — is said
Etaiḥ — by these
Vimohayati — deludes
Eṣaḥ — this (desire)
Jñānam — knowledge
Āvṛtya — enveloping
Dehinam — the embodied soul

**English Translation:**       
The senses, the mind, and the intellect are said to be its (lust's) sitting places. Through them, it deludes the embodied soul by veiling his knowledge.

**Explanation:**       
This shloka continues from the previous verses where Krishna is explaining the nature of desire (kāma), which is the root of sin and the destroyer of knowledge and wisdom.

Desire or lust takes its seat in the senses (indriya), mind (manas), and intellect (buddhi).
From these positions, it deludes the soul, clouding true knowledge and binding the individual to ignorance and illusion.
Even a wise person may be overpowered by desires if they are not alert and disciplined.

**Spiritual Insight:**      
To conquer desire, one must gain mastery over the senses, purify the mind, and sharpen the intellect. When these instruments are kept clean and focused on truth, the light of knowledge can shine unobstructed, and the soul moves closer to liberation.
