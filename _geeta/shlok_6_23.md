Here is Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 6, Shloka 23 (Sanskrit, transliteration, and meaning):

📜 Sanskrit

तं विद्यात् दुःखसंयोगवियोगं योगसञ्ज्ञितम्।
स निश्चयेन योक्तव्यो योगोऽनिर्विण्णचेतसा॥ ६-२३॥

🔤 Transliteration

taṁ vidyāt duḥkha-saṁyoga-viyogaṁ yoga-saṁjñitam
sa niścayena yoktavyo yogo’nirviṇṇa-cetasā

🌸 Meaning
That (state of steadfastness in the Self) is known as yoga—the disconnection from union with sorrow.
This yoga should be practiced with determination, and without any dejection or discouragement of mind.

🪷 Explanation
Krishna here defines yoga in a profound way:
Yoga = the severance (viyoga) from the union (saṁyoga) with sorrow (duḥkha).

A yogi does not merely endure suffering but transcends it by connecting with the higher Self.
The path requires firm determination (niścaya) and a steady, unshaken mind—not giving in to restlessness or despair.
It is a reminder that progress in yoga is gradual, and one must continue with patience and conviction.
