Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 6, Verse 25 (6.25):

Sanskrit (IAST):
शनेः शनेरुपरमेद् बुद्ध्या धृतिगृहीतया।
आत्मसंस्थं मनः कृत्वा न किञ्चिदपि चिन्तयेत्।। 6.25 ।।

Transliteration:
śanaiḥ śanairuparamed buddhyā dhṛti-gṛhītayā
ātma-saṁsthaṁ manaḥ kṛtvā na kiñcid api cintayet

Meaning:
Gradually, step by step, with determination and firm resolve, one should withdraw the mind from external distractions and steady it in the self. Fixing the mind upon the self, the yogi should refrain from thinking of anything else.

Explanation:

This verse continues the guidance on meditation (dhyāna-yoga).

It emphasizes gradual practice ("śanaiḥ śanaiḥ" – slowly, steadily) rather than sudden suppression.

The yogi uses buddhi (intellect) guided by dhṛti (firmness, perseverance) to bring the wandering mind under control.

The ultimate focus is ātma-saṁstham manaḥ – fixing the mind on the Self, not on external objects.

Once absorbed in the Self, na kiñcid api cintayet – the yogi does not engage in worldly or distracting thoughts.

👉 In simple terms: Through patience and discipline, the yogi gradually withdraws the mind from distractions, fixes it on the Self, and avoids letting it wander toward external matters.
