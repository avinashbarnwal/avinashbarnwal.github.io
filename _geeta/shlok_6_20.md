Sanskrit (IAST):   
yatroparamate cittaṁ niruddhaṁ yogasevayā    
yatra caivātmanātmānaṁ paśyann ātmani tuṣyati || 20 ||      

Transliteration:     
yatroparamate cittaṁ niruddhaṁ yogasevayā    
yatra caivātmanātmānaṁ paśyann ātmani tuṣyati ||     

Meaning (English):
When, through the practice of yoga, the mind becomes restrained and rests in the Self alone, then, beholding the Self by the Self, one is fully satisfied within.                

✨ Essence:      
This verse describes the state of a true yogi in meditation. When the mind is completely stilled through disciplined practice, the yogi realizes the Self within and experiences deep inner contentment and fulfillment—independent of external circumstances.
