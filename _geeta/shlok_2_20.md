Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2, Verse 20 (2.20) states:

"na jāyate mriyate vā kadācin
nāyaṁ bhūtvā bhavitā vā na bhūyaḥ
ajo nityaḥ śāśvato’yaṁ purāṇo
na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre"

Translation:
This Self is never born, nor does it ever perish; nor, having once existed, does it ever cease to be. Unborn, eternal, ever-existing, and primeval, it is not slain when the body is slain.

Interpretation:
This verse speaks to the immortal and indestructible nature of the soul. Krishna explains to Arjuna that the true Self (the soul) is eternal and beyond the cycles of birth and death. The body may perish, but the soul remains unaffected, enduring beyond physical existence. This verse is meant to inspire a sense of detachment from the body and attachment to the eternal essence within.
