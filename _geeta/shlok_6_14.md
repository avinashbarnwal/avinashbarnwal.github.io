Here’s Bhagavad Gita – Chapter 6, Verse 14 (6.14) in Sanskrit, transliteration, and meaning.

Sanskrit:
प्रशान्तात्मा विगतभीर्ब्रह्मचारिव्रते स्थितः ।
मनः संयम्य मच्चित्तो युक्त आसीत मत्परः ॥ १४ ॥


Meaning (simple):
With a calm mind, free from fear, firm in the vow of self-restraint, controlling the mind, and fixing the thoughts on Me, the yogi should sit, devoted to Me as the supreme goal.

Essence:
This verse builds on 6.13 — after describing the posture, Krishna emphasizes mental alignment: fearlessness, discipline, mind control, and devotion to the Supreme. The focus shifts from just physical steadiness to devotional concentration.
