**The shloka 2.70 from the Bhagavad Gita is as follows:**       

**Sanskrit:**     
आपूर्यमाणमचलप्रतिष्ठं
समुद्रमापः प्रविशन्ति यद्वत्।
तद्वत्कामा यं प्रविशन्ति सर्वे
स शान्तिमाप्नोति न कामकामी॥

**Transliteration:**        
Āpūryamāṇam achala-pratiṣṭhaṁ         
Samudram āpaḥ praviśanti yadvat।           
Tadvat kāmā yaṁ praviśanti sarve             
Sa śāntim āpnoti na kāma-kāmī॥           

**Translation:**             
A person who remains steady and unmoved like the ocean, into which waters flow constantly but does not overflow, achieves peace. However, a person who desires objects of sense gratification cannot attain peace.

**Explanation:**             
This verse uses the metaphor of the ocean to illustrate the state of a wise person. Just as the ocean remains unaffected by rivers constantly flowing into it, a self-realized individual remains undisturbed by the influx of desires. Such a person experiences true peace, unlike those who are constantly chasing or consumed by desires. The key message here is about detachment and inner stability.
