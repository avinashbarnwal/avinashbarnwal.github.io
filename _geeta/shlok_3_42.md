Of course! Here’s Bhagavad Gita 3.42 along with its summary:

श्लोक (Sanskrit):
इन्द्रियाणि पराण्याहुरिन्द्रियेभ्यः परं मनः।
मनसस्तु परा बुद्धिर्बुद्धेरात्मा महान् परः॥

English Translation:
"The senses are said to be superior to the body, the mind is superior to the senses, the intellect is superior to the mind, and the soul is superior to the intellect."

Summary:
In this verse, Shri Krishna explains the layers of human existence:

The senses (sight, touch, hearing, taste, smell) are superior to the gross body because they bring experience and action.

The mind is superior to the senses, as it governs and directs them.

The intellect (buddhi) is even higher, because it can reason, discern, and make decisions.

And finally, beyond all these, the soul (Atma) — the true self — is the highest, eternal, and most powerful.

Main teaching:

To master oneself and overcome desires, one should rise step-by-step:
control the senses → steady the mind → strengthen the intellect → realize the soul.

Thus, real self-mastery comes not just from controlling actions, but from knowing and connecting with one's own true nature — the Atma.
