Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 3, Shloka 4 (3.4):

Sanskrit:
न कर्मणामनारम्भान्नैष्कर्म्यं पुरुषोऽश्नुते।
न च सन्न्यसनादेव सिद्धिं समधिगच्छति॥

Transliteration:
na karmaṇām anārambhān naiṣkarmyaṁ puruṣo ’śnute
na ca sannyasanād eva siddhiṁ samadhigacchati

Translation:
A person does not attain freedom from action (naishkarmya) merely by abstaining from work, nor does one achieve perfection (siddhi) merely by renunciation.

Explanation:
In this verse, Krishna emphasizes the importance of action in the path of spiritual progress. 
He clarifies two key misconceptions:
Abstaining from Action: Simply avoiding responsibilities or work does not lead to liberation or freedom from the cycle of karma (action and its consequences).
Renunciation Alone: Merely renouncing the world outwardly without fulfilling duties and cultivating inner detachment does not bring spiritual success or self-realization.

Krishna advises that true renunciation lies in performing one’s duties selflessly and without attachment to the results, which aligns with the philosophy of Karma Yoga. This verse underlines the importance of engaging with the world while maintaining a higher spiritual perspective.
