**dnyeyah sa nityasanyasi yo na dveshti na kankshati .
nirdvandvo hi mahabaho sukham bandhatpramuchyate рее**

This verse from the Bhagavad Gita (Chapter 5, Verse 3) offers a profound teaching on renunciation and inner freedom. Here's a deeper explanation:
The verse says that the one who neither hates (dwells in aversion) nor desires (is filled with cravings) is a true renunciant, even if they are not outwardly living the life of a monk or ascetic. Renunciation here is not about physical withdrawal from the world, but rather a mental and emotional state where a person is no longer driven by strong likes or dislikes, attachments or aversions.
