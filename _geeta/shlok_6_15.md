Here is Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 6, Shloka 15 (6.15):

Sanskrit (IAST):

yuñjann evaṁ sadātmānaṁ
yogī niyata-mānasaḥ
śāntiṁ nirvāṇa-paramāṁ
mat-saṁsthām adhigacchati


Devanagari:

युञ्जन्नेवं सदात्मानं योगी नियतमानसः ।
शान्तिं निर्वाणपरमां मत्संस्थामधिगच्छति ॥

Translation

Literal meaning:
The yogi, constantly engaging the self in this manner, with the mind controlled and disciplined, attains peace—supreme Nirvāṇa—which abides in Me (the Supreme).

Simplified meaning:
A yogi who meditates steadily with a controlled mind, dedicating himself fully, reaches ultimate peace and liberation (nirvāṇa), resting in union with the Divine.

Explanation

This verse emphasizes the outcome of disciplined meditation (dhyāna-yoga).

By constant practice, the yogi’s mind becomes calm, steady, and detached from worldly distractions.

The reward is not just ordinary peace but the highest peace (nirvāṇa-śānti), which is freedom from all suffering and union with the eternal.

Krishna highlights that this liberation is attained by resting in Him (mat-saṁsthām), meaning in the Supreme Consciousness.
