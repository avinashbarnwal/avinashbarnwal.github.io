**Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 3, Verse 13 (3.13):**        

यज्ञशिष्टाशिनः सन्तो मुच्यन्ते सर्वकिल्बिषैः |                     
भुञ्जते ते त्वघं पापा ये पचन्त्यात्मकारणात् ||                           

**Transliteration:**        
Yajña-śiṣṭāśinaḥ santo mucyante sarva-kilbiṣaiḥ
Bhuñjate te tvaghaṁ pāpā ye pacanty ātma-kāraṇāt

**Translation:**        
The spiritually-minded, who partake of food that is first offered in sacrifice (to God), are freed from all sins. But those who prepare food for their own enjoyment (selfish purposes) verily eat sin.

**Explanation:**         
This verse highlights the importance of offering food to God before consumption. It emphasizes selflessness and gratitude, teaching that those who act with devotion and share their offerings are purified of their sins. Conversely, those who cook and eat solely for their own pleasure, without acknowledging the divine, accumulate negative karma.      

It encourages adopting a sacrificial and selfless attitude in life, aligning actions with higher spiritual principles rather than mere sensory gratification.
