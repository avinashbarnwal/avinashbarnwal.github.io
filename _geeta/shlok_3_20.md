**Here is Bhagavad Gita Chapter 3, Shloka 20, with its translation:**

Sanskrit: कर्मणैव हि संसिद्धिमास्थिता जनकादयः।          
लोकसंग्रहमेवापि सम्पश्यन्कर्तुमर्हसि॥      

**Transliteration:**                      
Karmaṇaiva hi saṁsiddhim āsthitā janakādayaḥ                          
Lokasaṅgraham evāpi sampaśyan kartum arhasi                           

Translation:                               
"By performing prescribed duties, King Janaka and others attained perfection. You should also perform your work with a view to guide and inspire the world."

Explanation:                 
In this shloka, Lord Krishna emphasizes the importance of selfless action (karma yoga). He cites the example of King Janaka and other wise leaders who achieved spiritual perfection while fulfilling their worldly responsibilities. The idea is that by performing one's duties without attachment, one not only progresses spiritually but also sets an example for others, contributing to the welfare of society (lokasangraha).
