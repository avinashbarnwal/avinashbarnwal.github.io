**Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2, Shloka 64:**

रागद्वेषवियुक्तैस्तु विषयानिन्द्रियैश्चरन्।
आत्मवश्यैर्विधेयात्मा प्रसादमधिगच्छति।।

**Transliteration:**       
Rāga-dveṣa-viyuktaiḥ tu viṣayān indriyaiḥ caran
Ātma-vaśyair vidheyātmā prasādam adhigacchati.

**Translation:**      
One who acts in the world, free from attachment and aversion, with the senses under self-control and aligned with the self, attains tranquility.

**Explanation:**       
This shloka highlights the importance of detachment and self-control. Krishna explains that a person who engages with the world without being influenced by likes (attachment) and dislikes (aversion) achieves inner peace. Such a state requires discipline over the senses and aligning oneself with higher wisdom, ultimately leading to mental clarity and serenity.
