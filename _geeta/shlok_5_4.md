**Chapter 5**       
**Verse 5.4**    
**uparyuktt sannyaas aur karmayog ko moorkh log prthak-prthak phal dene vaale kahate hain na ki panditajan ; kyonki donon mein se ek mein bhee samyak prakaar se sthit purush donon ke phalaroop paramaatma ko praapt hota hai**       

**Explanation**     
This verse is from the fifth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, where Lord Krishna explains to Arjuna the difference between renunciation (Sannyasa) and the path of selfless action (Karma Yoga). In this verse, Krishna says that foolish people think that renunciation (giving up actions) and Karma Yoga (performing actions without attachment) lead to different results, but wise people understand that both paths ultimately lead to the same goal, which is the attainment of the Supreme (God or liberation).

Renunciation refers to giving up worldly actions and dedicating oneself to meditation and contemplation, while Karma Yoga means performing one's duties and actions without attachment to the results. The wise understand that whether one follows the path of renunciation or the path of selfless action, as long as one is firmly established in either, the ultimate goal of attaining God or liberation can be achieved.

The key message is that it is not necessary to give up action in life to attain spiritual realization; one can achieve the same by performing actions selflessly, without attachment to their outcomes. Both paths, when followed properly, lead to the same divine goal.     

**Detailed Explanation**     
Gatee apne aap hota hai. Niskam ka koi test nai hota.  
Bal Bodhi ko ye lagta hai two things below are different: 
- Sankhya – Gyan 
- Yog 
Sankhya means Ahankar prakritik hai. 
- It exists – Behavior ke liye 
- It doesnt exits – In true sense, it doesnt. 
Mukt purush ko dona ka dhyan deta hai. 
Nahi satya ko bholta hai. Nahi tathya ko bholta hai. Tathya se satya takka rasta chalta hai. Kamne ke prati udasin ho jata hai. Niskaam and Karuna ek hin baat hai.  
Jo Kaam kar rahe ho, wahi urja deta hai.  
Russia mein Iron curtain tha.  
Kaam Sab Apne anusar karna hai. 
Aur milna sabko jaroort anusar hai. 
Above theory failed. Vaam Margya declared dharm is useless. Samyawad aur Dharm saath nai chale. Lao Tzhu says --> Asli cheez ko hone do, usko jayada janane ki kosish mat karo.  
Toh phir kya karein --> Apni Gandagi ko pata karo. Gyan maane apne aapko honesty se dekhna.
