Bhagavad Gita – Chapter 6, Shloka 27

Sanskrit (IAST):
प्रशान्तमनसं ह्येनं योगिनं सुखमुत्तमम् ।
उपैति शान्तरजसं ब्रह्मभूतमकल्मषम् ॥ ६.२७ ॥

Transliteration:
Praśānta-manasaṁ hyenaṁ yoginaṁ sukham uttamam,
upaiti śānta-rajasaṁ brahma-bhūtam akalmaṣam.

Translation (Literal Meaning):

Supreme bliss verily comes to this yogi whose mind has become peaceful, whose passions are calmed, who is free from sin, and who has become one with Brahman (the Supreme).

Detailed Explanation:

This verse describes the state of perfect peace and bliss attained by a true yogi through meditation and self-discipline.

“Praśānta-manasaṁ” — Calm Mind:
When the mind is free from restlessness, distractions, and desires, it naturally becomes tranquil. Such inner peace is the foundation of spiritual joy.

“Śānta-rajasaṁ” — With Passions Calmed:
“Rajas” represents activity, restlessness, and desire. When a yogi transcends this quality, the agitation of the mind ceases. Actions become selfless and serene.

“Brahma-bhūtam” — United with Brahman:
The yogi realizes the Self as not separate from the Supreme Being. This realization dissolves the sense of ego and separateness.

“Akalmaṣam” — Free from Sin or Impurity:
When one is established in the Self, karmic impurities (mental or moral) are destroyed. One becomes pure consciousness itself.

“Sukham uttamam” — Supreme Happiness:
This is not sensory pleasure but the highest, unbroken bliss that arises from inner realization — the bliss of unity with the Divine.

Essence / Practical Takeaway:
True happiness is not found in external possessions or fleeting pleasures,
but in the peace of a mind purified of desires, restlessness, and ego.
The one who attains this inner stillness becomes a reflection of Brahman itself —
serene, fulfilled, and radiant with joy.
