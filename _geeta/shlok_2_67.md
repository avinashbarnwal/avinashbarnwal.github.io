**The verse you are referring to is from the Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2, Shloka 67.**


**Here's the Sanskrit text along with its translation:**     

**Sanskrit:**     
इन्द्रियाणां हि चरतां यन्मनोऽनुविधीयते।       
तदस्य हरति प्रज्ञां वायुर्नावमिवाम्भसि।।          

**Transliteration:**     
Indriyāṇāṁ hi caratāṁ yan mano ’nuvidhīyate,            
Tad asya harati prajñāṁ vāyur nāvam ivāmbhasi.            

**Translation:**      
For a person whose mind follows the wandering senses, his intellect is carried away just as a boat is swept off course by the wind on water.

**Commentary:**         
This verse emphasizes the importance of controlling the mind and senses. When the mind indulges in the desires driven by the senses, it loses its steadiness and clarity. Just as a boat in a stormy sea is carried away by strong winds, similarly, a person without control over their senses is swayed by temptations and distractions, losing their ability to make sound decisions.
This verse advises cultivating self-discipline and focus to maintain wisdom and spiritual balance.
