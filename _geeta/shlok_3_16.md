**Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 3, Verse 16 (3.16):**

"evam pravartitam chakram nānuvartayatīha yaḥ
aghāyur indriyārāmo moghaṁ pārtha sa jīvati"

**Translation:**         
He who does not follow the eternal cycle of sacrifice (karma) established in this world, O Arjuna, lives a life of sin, indulging in sense pleasures; such a person lives in vain.

**Meaning:**        
This verse emphasizes the importance of performing selfless actions as part of the cosmic order. Lord Krishna explains that the universe operates in a cycle of giving and taking, where sacrifice sustains life and harmony. Those who neglect this duty and only seek personal gratification waste their lives and act against divine principles.

It highlights the spiritual importance of contributing to society and nature, fulfilling one’s responsibilities, and aligning actions with dharma (righteousness).
