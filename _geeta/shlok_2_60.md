**Here is the translation and meaning of Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2, Shloka 60:**

**Sanskrit:**
यततो ह्यपि कौन्तेय पुरुषस्य विपश्चितः।    
इन्द्रियाणि प्रमाथीनि हरन्ति प्रसभं मनः॥    

**Transliteration:**     
Yatato hyapi kaunteya puruṣhasya vipaśhchitaḥ      
Indriyāṇi pramāthīni haranti prasabhaṁ manaḥ.     

**Translation:**       
Even a wise person, who strives for self-control, can have their mind forcibly carried away by the turbulent senses, O Arjuna.

**Explanation:**           
**Indriyāṇi (senses):** The senses are naturally powerful and can easily disrupt one's concentration and focus.      
**Pramāthīni (turbulent):** The senses are described as restless and difficult to control.       
**Puruṣhasya vipaśhchitaḥ (a wise person):** Even those endowed with wisdom and intellect are not immune to the pull of sensory pleasures.     
**Yatato’pi (strives):** Despite efforts to control the mind and senses, they can overpower the individual.        
This shloka emphasizes the challenges of spiritual practice, illustrating how even those who are knowledgeable and disciplined must constantly guard against the distractions caused by sensory desires. It highlights the importance of vigilance and discipline in the path of self-mastery.
