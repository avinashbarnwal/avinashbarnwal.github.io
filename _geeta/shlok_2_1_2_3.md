**Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 2, Verse 1**         
सञ्जय उवाच
तं तथा कृपयाविष्टम् अश्रुपूर्णाकुलेक्षणम्।
विषीदन्तम् इदं वाक्यम् उवाच मधुसूदनः॥

**Translation:**      
Sanjaya said: To him, who was overwhelmed with compassion, whose eyes were filled with tears, and who was deeply dejected, Madhusudana (Krishna) spoke the following words.

**Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 2, Verse 2**         
श्रीभगवानुवाच
कुतस्त्वा कश्मलम् इदं विषमे समुपस्थितम्।
अनार्यजुष्टम् अस्वर्ग्यम् अकीर्तिकरम् अर्जुन॥

**Translation:**    
The Supreme Lord said: From where has this delusion overtaken you in this time of crisis, Arjuna? This attitude is not becoming of an honorable man; it does not lead to heaven and brings dishonor.

**Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 2, Verse 3**         
क्लैब्यं मा स्म गमः पार्थ नैतत्त्वय्युपपद्यते।
क्षुद्रं हृदयदौर्बल्यं त्यक्त्वोत्तिष्ठ परन्तप॥

**Translation:**      
Do not yield to this weakness, Arjuna. It does not befit you. Shake off this petty faint-heartedness and rise, O scorcher of enemies!

These verses capture Krishna's first response to Arjuna’s emotional breakdown on the battlefield, urging him to let go of his mental weakness and face his duty with courage.
