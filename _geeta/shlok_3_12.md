**Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 3, Verse 12 (3.12):**      

इष्टान्भोगान्हि वो देवा दास्यन्ते यज्ञभाविताः।     
तैर्दत्तानप्रदायैभ्यो यो भुङ्क्ते स्तेन एव सः॥        

**Transliteration:**    
Iṣṭān bhogān hi vo devā dāsyante yajña-bhāvitāḥ       
Tair dattān apradāyaibhyo yo bhuṅkte stena eva saḥ         

**Translation:**       
The demigods, nourished by sacrifices, will bestow upon you the desired necessities of life. But one who enjoys these gifts without offering them in return to the demigods is certainly a thief.           

**Explanation:**       
This verse highlights the principle of gratitude and reciprocity. It emphasizes that the universe operates on a cycle of giving and receiving, represented through the concept of Yajña (sacrifice). By performing selfless actions and offerings, humans contribute to the cosmic balance and are, in return, blessed with resources for their sustenance. However, those who consume these resources without acknowledging or giving back to the source are considered exploiters or thieves.        

This verse encourages practicing gratitude and maintaining harmony with nature and society.
