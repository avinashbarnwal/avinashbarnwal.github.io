In Chapter 5, Verse 7 of the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna describes the qualities and state of mind of a true yogi who is dedicated to selfless action. Here is the verse and its translation:

Verse (Sanskrit): "योगयुक्तो विशुद्धात्मा विजितात्मा जितेन्द्रियः | सर्वभूतात्मभूतात्मा कुर्वन्नपि न लिप्यते ||"

Translation: "The one who is devoted to the path of selfless action, whose mind is pure, who has control over the mind and senses, and who identifies with the well-being of all beings, is not tainted by actions even while engaged in work."

Explanation: This verse emphasizes the state of a person who, by practicing disciplined and selfless action, attains a purified mind, control over senses, and a deep sense of unity with all life. Such a person, despite performing duties and actions in the world, remains untouched by the consequences or bonds of these actions, as they do not act out of personal desire or ego but for the greater good.
