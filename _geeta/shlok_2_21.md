Here is verse 2.21 from the Bhagavad Gita:

वेदाविनाशिनं नित्यं य एनमजमव्ययम् |
कथं स पुरुषः पार्थ कं घातयति हन्ति कम् ||

Transliteration:

Vedāvināśinaṁ nityaṁ ya enam ajam avyayam
kathaṁ sa puruṣaḥ pārtha kaṁ ghātayati hanti kam

Translation:

"O Partha, one who knows the soul to be eternal, unborn, immutable, and indestructible—how can such a person kill or cause anyone to kill?"

Meaning: In this verse, Krishna is explaining to Arjuna that the true self (the soul) is beyond birth and death, eternal, and imperishable. Therefore, actions that affect the body do not harm the true self, as it transcends physical existence. Krishna encourages Arjuna to understand this concept deeply so that he can act with clarity and detachment, beyond the fear and sorrow of loss.
