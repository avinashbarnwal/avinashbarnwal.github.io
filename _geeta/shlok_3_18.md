Here is Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 3, Shloka 18 in Sanskrit along with its English translation:

Sanskrit:
नैव तस्य कृतेनार्थो नाकृतेनेह कश्चन।
न चास्य सर्वभूतेषु कश्चिदर्थव्यपाश्रयः॥

Transliteration:
Naiva tasya kṛtenārtho nākṛtena iha kaśchana,
Na chāsya sarva-bhūteṣhu kaśchid-artha-vyapāśhrayaḥ.

Translation:
A person who is satisfied in the self alone, and is content within themselves, has no duty to perform. Such a person is not dependent on any external agency or being for their purpose or fulfillment.

This shloka emphasizes self-sufficiency and inner satisfaction, highlighting that one who is established in the self does not rely on external factors or actions for happiness or purpose.
