**Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2, Verse 65 (2.65):**

प्रसादे सर्वदुःखानां हानिरस्योपजायते।
प्रसन्नचेतसो ह्याशु बुद्धिः पर्यवतिष्ठते।।

**Transliteration:**    
prasāde sarva-duḥkhānāṁ hānir asyopajāyate
prasanna-cetaso hy āśu buddhiḥ paryavatiṣṭhate

**Translation:**   
When one achieves inner tranquility (prasāda), all miseries are destroyed. The intellect of such a serene person becomes firmly established in self-realization.

**Explanation:**             
This verse highlights the transformative power of inner peace. When the mind is free from disturbances and achieves a tranquil state, all sorrows and miseries fade away. A person in this state gains clarity of thought and develops a steady intellect, which leads to wisdom and spiritual progress.
This verse emphasizes the importance of emotional stability and peace of mind for spiritual growth and overall well-being.
