**Here is Shloka 2.71 from the Bhagavad Gita along with its transliteration and meaning:**       

**Sanskrit:**      
वीतरागभयक्रोधः स्थितधीर्मुनिरुच्यते।
यः सर्वत्रानभिस्नेहस्तत्तत्प्राप्य शुभाशुभम्॥ 2.71॥

**Transliteration:**      
Vīta-rāga-bhaya-krodhaḥ sthita-dhīr munir uchyate,
Yaḥ sarvatra-anabhisnehah tat-tat prāpya śubhāśubham.

**Meaning:**        
A person who is free from attachment, fear, and anger, who is steadfast in wisdom, and indifferent to all worldly things, whether auspicious or inauspicious, is called a sage of steady mind (sthita-dhī).

This shloka emphasizes detachment and equanimity as key qualities for attaining a stable and wise state of mind. It encourages individuals to remain unaffected by the dualities of life, such as success and failure, good and bad, joy and sorrow.
