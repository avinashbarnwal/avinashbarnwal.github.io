Here is Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 6, Verse 19 (6.19) in Sanskrit with translation and explanation:

📜 Sanskrit Shloka      
यथा दीपो निवातस्थो नेङ्गते सोपमा स्मृता ।
योगिनो यतचित्तस्य युञ्जतो योगमात्मनः ॥ १९ ॥

🌍 Transliteration        
Yathā dīpo nivātastho neṅgate sopamā smṛtā
yogino yata-cittasya yuñjato yogam ātmanaḥ

📖 Translation (Simple English)     
Just as a lamp in a windless place does not flicker, so is the mind of a yogi who is disciplined and absorbed in the practice of yoga upon the Self.

✨ Explanation
- "Yathā dīpo nivātasthaḥ" – Like a lamp placed where there is no wind.   
- "Neṅgate" – It does not waver or flicker.
- "Sopamā smṛtā" – This is the comparison (upamā) used.
- "Yogino yata-cittasya" – The yogi with a controlled and disciplined mind.
- "Yuñjato yogam ātmanaḥ" – Engaged in uniting the mind with the Self.

The verse beautifully illustrates steadiness of meditation:
A yogi’s concentrated mind is compared to a steady flame.   
Without distractions (“winds”), the mind rests unwaveringly in the Self.   

It is a state of deep meditation and inner absorption, where thoughts no longer disturb the consciousness.
