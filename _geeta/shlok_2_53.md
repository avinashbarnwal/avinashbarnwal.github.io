**Here is Bhagavad Gita Chapter 2, Verse 53 with its translation:**

**Sanskrit:**        
श्रुतिविप्रतिपन्ना ते यदा स्थास्यति निश्चला।         
समाधावचला बुद्धिस्तदा योगमवाप्स्यसि।।             

**Transliteration:**       
śruti-vipratipannā te yadā sthāsyati niścalā |          
samādhāv-acalā buddhis tadā yogam-avāpsyasi ||             

**Translation:**           
When your intellect, bewildered by the conflicting opinions of the scriptures, remains steadfast and immovable in meditation, then you shall attain the state of perfect yoga (self-realization).          

**Meaning:**          
This verse highlights the importance of a steady and unwavering intellect in the spiritual journey. Krishna explains that one should transcend the confusion caused by varied scriptural interpretations and cultivate a focused mind. Such a mind, fixed in meditation and unshaken by doubts, leads one to the ultimate goal of yoga—union with the divine or self-realization.
