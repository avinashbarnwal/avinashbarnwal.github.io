Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2, Verse 57:

Sanskrit:
यः सर्वत्रानभिस्नेहस्तत्तत्प्राप्य शुभाशुभम्।
नाभिनन्दति न द्वेष्टि तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिता।।

Transliteration:
yaḥ sarvatra anabhisnehaḥ tat tat prāpya śubhāśubham
na abhinandati na dveṣṭi tasya prajñā pratiṣṭhitā

Translation:
One who is unattached to everything, who neither rejoices upon obtaining good nor laments upon receiving evil, is firmly fixed in perfect wisdom.

Explanation:
This verse elaborates further on the qualities of a person with a steady mind (sthita-prajña):

Detachment from Outcomes: Such a person is not overly attached to anything, whether material possessions, relationships, or outcomes.
Neutral Reaction to Dualities: They remain unaffected by the dualities of life, such as good (śubha) and bad (aśubha) experiences.
Freedom from Emotional Extremes: They neither celebrate excessively when something good happens nor fall into despair when something bad occurs.
Steady Wisdom: This state of balance and equanimity reflects the individual's firm grounding in spiritual wisdom and self-realization.
This verse highlights the importance of equanimity and detachment in spiritual practice. By not getting swayed by external circumstances, one can achieve inner peace and wisdom, a central teaching of the Bhagavad Gita.
