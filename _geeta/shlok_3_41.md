Bhagavad Gita Chapter 3, Shloka 41 (3.41) is as follows in Sanskrit, along with its transliteration and meaning:

**Sanskrit:**   

तस्मात्त्वमिन्द्रियाण्यादौ नियम्य भरतर्षभ।
पाप्मानं प्रजहि ह्येनं ज्ञानविज्ञाननाशनम्॥

**Transliteration:**     

Tasmāt tvam indriyāṇy ādau niyamya bharatarṣabha
pāpmānaṁ prajahi hy enaṁ jñāna-vijñāna-nāśanam

**Meaning (Translation):**      

"Therefore, O best of the Bharatas, first control the senses, and then kill this evil (desire) which is the destroyer of knowledge and wisdom."

**Explanation:**       
In this verse, Shri Krishna advises Arjuna to begin by restraining the senses, which are the gateway to worldly desires. He emphasizes that lust or desire (kāma) is the root of sin and leads to the destruction of both knowledge (jñāna) and wisdom (vijñāna). Therefore, to progress on the spiritual path, one must control desires at their source.
