**Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2, Verse 52,** -  describes the state of wisdom where the intellect transcends confusion and attachment.        

Here is the verse in Sanskrit, along with its transliteration and meaning:           

**Sanskrit:**                 
यदा ते मोहकलिलं बुद्धिर्व्यतितरिष्यति।           
तदा गन्तासि निर्वेदं श्रोतव्यस्य श्रुतस्य च।।            

**Transliteration:**              
Yadā te mohakalilaṁ buddhir vyatitariṣyati,          
Tadā gantāsi nirvedaṁ śrotavyasya śrutasya ca.        

**Translation:**                
"When your intellect transcends the dense forest of delusion, you shall become indifferent to all that has been heard and all that is to be heard."

**Meaning:**                     
This verse emphasizes the clarity of mind achieved through self-realization and wisdom. When one overcomes confusion and delusion, their intellect becomes steady. At this stage, worldly desires and attachments no longer bind them, and they attain disinterest in materialistic knowledge and experiences, focusing solely on the eternal truth.

This verse highlights the journey toward spiritual discernment and inner peace.
