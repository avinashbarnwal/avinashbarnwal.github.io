Transliteration          
​āvṛtaṁ jñānam etena jñānino nitya-vairiṇā          
kāma-rūpeṇa kaunteya duṣpūreṇānalena ca​         

Translation           
"O son of Kunti, knowledge is covered by this eternal enemy of the wise, in the form of insatiable desire, which burns like fire."       
Commentary          
In this verse, Lord Krishna emphasizes how desire (kāma) acts as an eternal adversary to wisdom. Even the discerning can find their knowledge obscured by the relentless nature of desire, which, like fire, intensifies the more it is fed. This metaphor illustrates that indulging desires doesn't quell them; instead, it amplifies their intensity, leading to a cycle of perpetual dissatisfaction. Recognizing and mastering this internal foe is crucial for spiritual advancement and liberation
