श्लोक 6.13
सम्प्रेक्ष्य नासिकाग्रं स्वं दिशश्चानवलोकयन्।
प्रशान्तात्मा विगतभीर्ब्रह्मचारिव्रते स्थितः॥

Transliteration:

saṁprekṣya nāsikāgraṁ svaṁ diśaś cānavalokayan |
praśāntātmā vigata-bhīr brahmacārī-vrate sthitaḥ ||

Simple English Translation:
With a calm mind, free from fear,
firmly established in the vow of celibacy (discipline),
let the yogi fix his gaze steadily on the tip of his nose,
not looking around in other directions.

Explanation:
This verse continues the guidance for meditation from the previous verses. It advises the practitioner to:
Gaze steadily at the tip of the nose — a classic yogic practice to withdraw the senses.
Avoid glancing around, thus encouraging one-pointed focus.
Cultivate a peaceful inner state (praśānta-ātmā), removing fear (vigata-bhīḥ).
Be established in discipline and restraint (brahmacārī-vrate), which includes self-control of senses, speech, and thoughts.
This verse highlights external posture and internal mindset both — focusing and steadying the body and senses as a gateway to deeper concentration and union (yoga).
