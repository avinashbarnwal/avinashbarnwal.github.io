**The Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2, Verse 14 (Śloka 2.14) **

Emphasizes the transient nature of sensory experiences and encourages equanimity. Here is the Sanskrit text along with its transliteration and translation:

Sanskrit (Śloka 2.14):
मात्रास्पर्शास्तु कौन्तेय शीतोष्णसुखदुःखदाः।
आगमापायिनोऽनित्यास्तांस्तितिक्षस्व भारत॥


**Transliteration:**
Mātrā-sparśās tu kaunteya śītoṣṇa-sukha-duḥkha-dāḥ
Āgamāpāyino’nityās tāṁs titikṣasva bhārata

**Translation:**
"O son of Kunti (Arjuna), the contact between the senses and their objects produces sensations of heat and cold, pleasure and pain. These experiences are temporary, arising and passing away; therefore, O Bhārata, endure them patiently."

**Meaning:**       
In this verse, Krishna advises Arjuna to maintain composure amidst life’s ups and downs. Sensory experiences—like pleasure and pain—are impermanent. They come and go, just like seasons. Krishna teaches that one should develop the quality of titikṣā (forbearance or endurance) to maintain inner peace despite external changes.


This verse encourages emotional resilience and is often cited as a reminder to stay calm in both joy and sorrow.
