**The Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2, Verse 16, says:**       

"nāsato vidyate bhāvo nābhāvo vidyate sataḥ | ubhayor api dṛṣṭo ’ntas tv anayos tattva-darśibhiḥ"

**Translation:**     
"The unreal has no existence, and the real never ceases to be; the seers of truth have concluded the same, regarding both of these."

**Explanation:**     
This verse distinguishes between the eternal and the temporary. Here, Lord Krishna explains to Arjuna that the world of appearances is transient, constantly changing and ultimately unreal. In contrast, the soul (or Atman) is eternal, unchanging, and real. The wise, who see the truth, understand the difference between the temporary nature of the body and the timeless essence of the soul.

This is a core teaching in the Gita, emphasizing the imperishable nature of the soul and encouraging detachment from the physical realm, which is subject to change.
