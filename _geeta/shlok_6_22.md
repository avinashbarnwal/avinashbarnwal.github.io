Here is Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 6, Shloka 22 (6.22):

Sanskrit (IAST):
yaṁ labdhvā cāparaṁ lābhaṁ manyate nādhikaṁ tataḥ
yasmin sthito na duḥkhena guruṇāpi vicālyate

Devanagari:
यं लब्ध्वा चापरं लाभं मन्यते नाधिकं ततः।
यस्मिन्स्थितो न दुःखेन गुरुणापि विचाल्यते।।6.22।।

Word-by-Word Meaning

yam labdhvā – having obtained which

ca aparam lābham – no other gain

manyate na adhikam tataḥ – is considered greater than that

yasmin sthitaḥ – being established in which

na duḥkhena guruṇā api – not even by heavy sorrow

vicālyate – one is shaken

Translation

“When one attains that state, he considers no other gain superior to it. Being established in that, even great sorrow cannot shake him.”

Explanation

Shri Krishna here describes the perfection of yoga (union with the Self / Atman).

Once the yogi experiences the supreme bliss of union with the Self, all worldly gains appear insignificant.

This spiritual joy is beyond material pleasures, success, or achievements.

Established in this state, the yogi remains unshaken even in the face of intense suffering, loss, or misfortune.

It highlights the unshakable stability of the self-realized person, who is beyond the dualities of joy and sorrow.
