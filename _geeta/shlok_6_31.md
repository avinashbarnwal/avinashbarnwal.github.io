Bhagavad Gita – Chapter 6, Verse 31 (Detailed Explanation in English)

Sanskrit Verse

Sarva-bhūta-sthitaṁ yo māṁ bhajaty ekatvam āsthitaḥ |
Sarvathā vartamāno’pi sa yogī mayi vartate ||

Word-by-word Meaning

Sarva-bhūta-sthitam – Present in all beings

Yo mām bhajati – One who worships Me

Ekatvam āsthitaḥ – Established in the vision of oneness

Sarvathā vartamānaḥ api – No matter how one lives or acts

Sa yogī – That yogi

Mayi vartate – Abides in Me

Expanded Meaning

A yogi who perceives the Divine as present in every living being, and who is firmly established in the understanding of oneness, worships God in the truest sense. Such a person does not see separation—between self and others, sacred and ordinary, action and devotion.

Even while actively participating in the world—working, speaking, leading, or serving—this yogi remains inwardly united with God. Their external life may change, but their inner alignment does not.

Philosophical Significance

Oneness (Advaita in practice): The verse emphasizes lived unity, not just intellectual belief.

True Yoga: Yoga is not withdrawal from life, but continuous God-consciousness amid action.

Integration of Paths:

Bhakti – devotion to God

Jnana – knowledge of oneness

Karma – action without inner separation

Practical Life Application

See the same worth and dignity in everyone—colleagues, family, strangers.

Act with compassion and fairness, knowing the same consciousness flows through all.

Stay rooted in inner values even while handling pressure, success, or failure.

Core Message
👉 When you see the One in all and all in the One, you never lose connection with the Divine—no matter what you are doing.
