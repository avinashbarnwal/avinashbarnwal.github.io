**Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 3, Verse 11 (3.11):**       

**Sanskrit:**    
देवान् भावयतानेन ते देवा भावयन्तु वः।      
परस्परं भावयन्तः श्रेयः परमवाप्स्यथ॥        

**Transliteration:**       
Devān bhāvayatānena te devā bhāvayantu vaḥ।         
Parasparaṁ bhāvayantaḥ śreyaḥ param avāpsyatha॥         

**Translation:**          
Nourish the gods (divine forces) through sacrifices, and they will nourish you in return. Thus, by supporting one another, you shall attain the highest good.

**Meaning:**          
This verse highlights the principle of mutual cooperation and harmony between humans and divine forces. It emphasizes the idea that offerings and sacrifices (yajña) made to the divine result in blessings, which in turn foster prosperity and well-being. The verse encourages performing selfless actions to sustain universal balance and achieve spiritual and material growth.
