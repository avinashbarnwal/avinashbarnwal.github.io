Translation (simple):
Abandoning all desires born of imagination and mental resolve, and fully controlling the senses from all sides with the mind alone.

Meaning / Explanation:

This shloka is about discipline in meditation (dhyana-yoga).

Desires arise from sa·πÖkalpa (mental imaginations, cravings, or thoughts of ‚ÄúI want this‚Äù). To progress spiritually, one must renounce such desires completely.

The senses naturally chase worldly objects. Here, Krishna guides the yogi to restrain the senses through the mind, keeping them under control instead of letting them wander.

In practice, this means cultivating detachment from sensual cravings and disciplining the mind so it governs the senses, rather than being pulled around by them.

üëâ In short: A yogi on the path of meditation should drop desires born of imagination, and use the disciplined mind to fully restrain the senses.
