Here’s Bhagavad Gita Chapter 3, Shloka 43 in English:        

**Sanskrit (Original):**        
evaṁ buddheḥ paraṁ buddhvā saṁstabhyātmānam ātmanā
jahi śhatruṁ mahā-bāho kāma-rūpaṁ durāsadam



**English Translation:**       
Thus, understanding the self to be transcendental to material intelligence, O mighty-armed Arjun, subdue the desire which is the formidable enemy by regulating the mind with the intellect.



**Summary of the Message:**        
Krishna advises Arjuna that even beyond the mind and intellect lies the pure self (soul). By stabilizing the mind through higher knowledge and self-discipline, one must conquer the enemy called desire, which is extremely difficult to defeat but necessary for self-realization and true liberation.
