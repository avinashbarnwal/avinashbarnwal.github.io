The Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2, Shloka 58 reads:

यदा संहरते चायं कूर्मोऽङ्गानीव सर्वश:।
इन्द्रियाणीन्द्रियार्थेभ्यस्तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिता।।

Transliteration:
Yadā saṁharate chāyaṁ kūrmo'ṅgānīva sarvaśaḥ,
Indriyāṇīndriyārthebhyas tasya prajñā pratiṣṭhitā.

Translation:
"When, like a tortoise retracts its limbs from all sides, a person withdraws their senses from the sense-objects, their wisdom becomes steady and well-established."

Explanation:
This verse emphasizes self-control and restraint. It compares a wise person to a tortoise that withdraws its limbs into its shell for protection. Similarly, a person who can withdraw their senses from the temptations of the external world achieves stability of mind and true wisdom. This is a key teaching of the Gita about mastering desires and achieving mental peace.
