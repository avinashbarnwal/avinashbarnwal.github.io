📜 Bhagavad Gita 6.29

Sanskrit:
सर्वभूतस्थमात्मानं सर्वभूतानि चात्मनि ।
ईक्षते योगयुक्तात्मा सर्वत्र समदर्शनः ॥ ६.२९ ॥

Transliteration:
sarva-bhūta-stham ātmānaṁ sarva-bhūtāni cātmani
īkṣate yoga-yuktātmā sarvatra sama-darśanaḥ

✨ Translation (Simple English)

A yogi whose mind is united with the Divine sees the Self present in all beings, and all beings present in the Self.
Such a person sees everything with an equal vision.

🧘‍♂️ Deep Meaning & Insight

This shloka describes the peak of meditation (Dhyana Yoga):

1️⃣ Seeing the One in the Many

A true yogi realizes that the same Atman (consciousness) resides in every being — human, animal, plant, friend, or enemy.

2️⃣ Seeing the Many in the One

He also sees that all beings ultimately exist within that same universal Self — connected, interdependent, and divine.

3️⃣ The State of Equal Vision (समदर्शन)

This doesn’t mean everyone behaves the same.
It means the yogi looks beyond outer differences and sees the same divine spark in everyone.

4️⃣ Outcome: Compassion, peace, and absence of hatred

When you truly feel others are part of you,
✔ judgment drops
✔ ego dissolves
✔ compassion naturally arises
✔ conflicts reduce
✔ inner peace grows

This is the vision of unity that meditation brings.
