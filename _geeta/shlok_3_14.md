**Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 3, Verse 14 (3.14):**    

अन्नाद्भवन्ति भूतानि पर्जन्यादन्नसम्भवः।
यज्ञाद्भवति पर्जन्यो यज्ञः कर्मसमुद्भवः।।

**Transliteration:**     
Annād bhavanti bhūtāni parjanyād anna-sambhavaḥ।       
Yajñād bhavati parjanyo yajñaḥ karma-samudbhavaḥ।।        

**Translation:**   
All living beings are sustained by food, and food is produced by rain. Rain arises from the performance of sacrifice (yajña), and sacrifice is born of prescribed duties (karma).

**Meaning:**      
This verse emphasizes the interconnectedness of life and nature. It highlights the cycle of sustenance, where food nourishes beings, rain produces food, and rain results from sacrifices performed through rightful actions (karma). Sacrifices symbolize selfless actions dedicated to a higher purpose, maintaining harmony in nature and society.

The verse encourages performing one's duties selflessly to sustain the natural order and uphold balance in life.
