Bhagavad Gita 2.18

"Antavanta ime deha nityasyoktah sharirinah | Anashinoâ€™prameyasya tasmad yudhyasva Bharata ||"

Translation:

"These bodies are said to have an end, but the soul is eternal, indestructible, and immeasurable. Therefore, O Bharata (Arjuna), fight."

Explanation: In this verse, Lord Krishna teaches Arjuna that the physical body is temporary and subject to death, but the soul, or the true self, is eternal and cannot be destroyed. The body may perish, but the soul remains unchanged. Krishna encourages Arjuna to fulfill his duty as a warrior without being attached to the physical consequences, understanding that the soul transcends the life and death of the body.

This teaching is a core principle of the Gita's philosophy, emphasizing detachment from the material and attachment to one's higher duty and true self.
