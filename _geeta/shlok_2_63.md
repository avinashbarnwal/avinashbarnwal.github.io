**The verse from the Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2, Shloka 63, is as follows:**     

**Shloka:**      
क्रोधाद्भवति सम्मोहः सम्मोहात्स्मृतिविभ्रमः।          
स्मृतिभ्रंशाद् बुद्धिनाशो बुद्धिनाशात्प्रणश्यति॥        

**Transliteration:**        
Krodhād bhavati sammohaḥ, sammohāt smṛiti-vibhramaḥ;          
Smṛiti-bhraṁśād buddhi-nāśo, buddhi-nāśāt praṇaśyati.       

**Translation:**       
From anger arises delusion, from delusion comes loss of memory;         
From the loss of memory, the destruction of intellect; and when the intellect is destroyed, one is ruined.           

**Explanation:**       
This verse describes the chain reaction of negative emotions and their impact on human behavior. It emphasizes how unchecked anger can lead to confusion and poor decision-making. Delusion clouds judgment, leading to memory loss of one’s values and wisdom. This ultimately results in the destruction of intellect, causing one’s downfall. This shloka highlights the importance of self-control and maintaining emotional balance.
