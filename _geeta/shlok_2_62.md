**The Bhagavad Gita, Shloka 2.62, is as follows:**

**द्वितीय अध्याय - 62 श्लोक:**
ध्यायतो विषयान्पुंसः संगस्तेषूपजायते।
संगात् संजायते कामः कामात्क्रोधोऽभिजायते।।

**Transliteration:**      
Dhyāyato viṣayān puṁsaḥ saṅgas teṣūpajāyate।     
Saṅgāt sañjāyate kāmaḥ kāmāt krodho'bhijāyate।।      

**Translation:**        
When a person constantly thinks about sense objects, attachment to them arises. From attachment, desire is born, and from desire, anger arises.

**Explanation:**        
This shloka explains the progression of attachment and its consequences:

Constant contemplation on sense objects leads to attachment.         
Attachment generates desires.        
Unfulfilled desires lead to frustration and anger.          
This is a caution about the cycle of desires and emotions that can disturb mental peace and lead to unwise actions.          
Cultivating detachment and self-control helps in maintaining equanimity.
