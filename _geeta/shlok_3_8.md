**Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 3, Verse 8 (3.8):**   

"niyataṁ kuru karma tvaṁ
karma jyāyo hy akarmaṇaḥ
śarīra-yātrāpi ca te
na prasiddhyed akarmaṇaḥ"

**Translation:**     
Perform your prescribed duties, for action is better than inaction. Even the maintenance of your body would not be possible without action.

**Explanation:**    
In this verse, Lord Krishna advises Arjuna to fulfill his duties without neglect. He explains that performing one's responsibilities is superior to idleness because inactivity cannot sustain life. Even basic survival, such as feeding the body, requires effort.

Krishna emphasizes the importance of action (karma) and discourages complete renunciation of duties. Instead, he advocates for selfless action (karma yoga) as a path to both material and spiritual fulfillment.
