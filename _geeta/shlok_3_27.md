**Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 3, Shloka 27:**

प्रकृतेः क्रियमाणानि गुणैः कर्माणि सर्वशः।        
अहङ्कारविमूढात्मा कर्ताहमिति मन्यते॥ ३.२७॥       

**Translation:**     
All actions are performed by the modes (gunas) of material nature (Prakriti). But the one whose mind is deluded by ego thinks, "I am the doer."

**Explanation:**        
Krishna explains that everything happening in the world is driven by the three gunas (Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas) of nature. However, due to ignorance and false ego, people assume they are the ones in control of their actions. In reality, our thoughts, decisions, and actions are influenced by the natural tendencies and qualities we possess.     

This verse encourages humility and detachment, reminding us that we are instruments of the divine, and our role is to perform our duties without attachment to the sense of doership.
