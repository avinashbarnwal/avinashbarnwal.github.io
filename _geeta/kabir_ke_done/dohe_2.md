**The full couplet is:**

**"निंदक नियरे राखिए, आंगन कुटी छवाय।
बिन पानी साबुन बिना, निर्मल करे सुभाय।।"**

**Meaning:**    
Kabir suggests that you should keep your critics (nindak) close, even offering them a place to stay in your courtyard. Their criticism acts like a cleansing agent, improving your character without the need for water or soap.

**Interpretation:**       
The message emphasizes the value of constructive criticism. Critics help us recognize our flaws and push us toward self-improvement. Rather than avoiding or being offended by criticism, we should welcome it as a tool for personal growth.

This wisdom encourages humility, introspection, and a positive attitude toward life's challenges.
