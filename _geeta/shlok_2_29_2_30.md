Here are the verses from the Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2, Shloks 2.29 and 2.30:       

Bhagavad Gita 2.29:       

आश्चर्यवत्पश्यति कश्चिदेनम् आश्चर्यवद्वदति तथैव चान्यः।          
आश्चर्यवच्चैनमन्यः श्रृणोति श्रुत्वाप्येनं वेद न चैव कश्चित्॥          

Transliteration:          
āśhcharya-vat paśhyati kaśhchid enam āśhcharya-vad vadati tathaiva chānyaḥ,            
āśhcharya-vach chainam anyaḥ śhṛiṇoti śhrutvāpy enaṁ veda na chaiva kaśhchit            

Translation:           
"Some see the soul as amazing, some describe it as amazing, and some hear of it as amazing, while others, even after hearing about it, cannot understand it at all."

Bhagavad Gita 2.30:         

देही नित्यमवध्योऽयं देहे सर्वस्य भारत।                 
तस्मात्सर्वाणि भूतानि न त्वं शोचितुमर्हसि॥                      

Transliteration:                               
dehī nityam avadhyo 'yaṁ dehe sarvasya bhārata                                   
tasmāt sarvāṇi bhūtāni na tvaṁ śhochitum arhasi                      

Translation:                          
"The soul in the body of every being is indestructible, O Arjun; therefore, you should not mourn for any living being."                       

These verses convey the nature of the soul, emphasizing its eternal and indestructible qualities. While many marvel at it, true understanding of the soul is rare. The message is to encourage detachment from grief over physical loss, understanding that the soul is beyond harm.
