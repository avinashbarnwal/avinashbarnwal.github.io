**Here are the verses from Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 5, Verses 8 and 9:**        

**Sanskrit:**      
**नैव किञ्चित्करोमीति युक्तो मन्येत तत्त्ववित् | पश्यञ्श्रृण्वन्स्पृशञ्जिघ्रन्नश्नन्गच्छन्स्वपंश्वसन् || 5.8 ||**       

**प्रलपन्विसृजन्गृह्णन्नुन्मिषन्निमिषन्नपि | इन्द्रियाणीन्द्रियार्थेषु वर्तन्त इति धारयन् || 5.9 ||**      

Transliteration: Naiva kinchit karomi iti yukto manyeta tattvavit | Pashyan shrunvan sprishan jighrann ashnan gacchan svapan shvasan || 5.8 ||

Pralapan visrijan grihnann unmisann imisann api | Indriyani indriyartheshu vartanta iti dharayan || 5.9 ||

Translation: 5.8: "A person in the state of union with the Divine, who understands the essence of reality, should think, 'I do nothing at all,' even while seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, moving, sleeping, and breathing."

5.9: "While speaking, giving up, grasping, opening and closing the eyes, he should understand that it is only the senses interacting with their objects."

Explanation: In these verses, Krishna describes the mindset of a spiritually aware person, someone who has attained self-realization. Such a person, even while engaged in various actions, maintains a sense of detachment by understanding that it is merely the body and senses performing the actions, not the true Self.

The enlightened soul realizes that actions are performed by the body through interaction of the senses with the sense objects, and thus remains unaffected, perceiving themselves as separate from the physical actions. This perspective leads to inner peace and liberation from the binding effects of karma, as actions are carried out without attachment or ego.
