Here is Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 6, Shloka 17 (6.17):

Sanskrit (IAST):
yuktāhāra-vihārasya yukta-ceṣṭasya karmasu
yukta-svapnāvabodhasya yogo bhavati duḥkha-hāḥ

Devanagari:
युक्ताहारविहारस्य युक्तचेष्टस्य कर्मसु।
युक्तस्वप्नावबोधस्य योगो भवति दुःखहा।।6.17।।

Meaning:

For one who is moderate in food and recreation,
balanced in work and effort,
regulated in sleep and wakefulness —
Yoga becomes the destroyer of sorrow.

Explanation:

युक्त आहार (Yukta Āhāra) → Taking food in moderation, neither too little nor too much.

विहार (Vihāra) → Recreation, relaxation, and lifestyle in balance.

चेष्टा कर्मसु (Ceṣṭā Karmasu) → Balanced effort in duties and actions.

स्वप्न-Āवबोध (Svapna-Āvabodha) → Proper regulation of sleep and wakefulness.

➡️ Such discipline creates harmony in body and mind, enabling yoga (union with the Self) to remove suffering and mental distress.

✨ In simple terms: Yoga succeeds not through extremes of austerity or indulgence, but through moderation and balance in all aspects of life.
