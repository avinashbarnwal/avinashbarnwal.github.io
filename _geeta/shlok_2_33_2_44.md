Verse 2.34
Translation:
People will always speak of your disgrace. And for one who has been honored, disgrace is worse than death.

Verse 2.35
Translation:
The great warriors who held you in high esteem will think you retreated out of fear, and you will be considered insignificant.

Verse 2.36

Verse 2.38
Translation:
Treat pleasure and pain, gain and loss, victory and defeat alike; then prepare for battle. By doing so, you will not incur sin.

Meaning:
This verse introduces the idea of equanimity and detachment, which is central to the Gita's philosophy—performing duty without attachment to outcomes.

Verse 2.42–2.43
Translation:
People with limited understanding are attached to the flowery words of the Vedas, which promise enjoyment in heaven and rebirth as the reward for actions. They are full of desires and seek power and pleasures.

Meaning:
Krishna critiques those who are overly attached to ritualistic rewards, urging Arjuna to rise above such desires and pursue higher spiritual goals.

Verse 2.44

The resolute intellect of those who are attached to pleasure and power is not focused on Samadhi (state of self-realization).

Meaning:

These verses guide Arjuna toward fulfilling his duty with detachment and focus, emphasizing the spiritual path over materialistic or ego-driven goals.
