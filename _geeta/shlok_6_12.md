Transliteration
*tatra ekāgraṁ manaḥ kṛtvā yata-citta-indriya-kriyāḥ
upaviśhy āsane yuñjyād yogam ātma-viśuddhaye*

Literal English Translation
“There, having made the mind one-pointed and restrained the activities of the mind and senses, seated firmly on the seat, one should practice yoga for the purification of the self.” 


🌟 Context & Meaning
This verse continues the meditation instructions from verse 11 (which emphasizes finding a serene and appropriate seat in a clean, secluded spot). Verse 12 adds:

One-pointed mind (ekāgra): Bring the mind into focused concentration.
Control of mind and senses: Sit with body, head, and neck steady, while stilling sensory impulses.
Practice of yoga: This disciplined meditation serves to purify the inner self (mind/heart/intellect).

Essentially, Krishna instructs disciplined, focused inner practice as the path to inner purity. 


📘 Deeper Insight
According to Gitajourney.com, meditation in Gītā culminates the process of cleansing three main impurities of personality—mala (dirt), vikshepa (distraction), and āvaraṇa (veil)—leading to the clarity of intellect (ātma-viśuddhi) 

🧘‍♂️ In Practice    
To apply this:   
- Choose a quiet, clean spot and a comfortable, steady seat.
- Sit upright, body still.
- Bring the mind to a single point—typically the breath or an internal focal point.
- Calm the senses and thoughts.

Maintain this inner focus to purify and steady the mind.
