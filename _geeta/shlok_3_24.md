**The Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 3, Verse 24 (श्लोक 3.24) states:**

**सक्ताः कर्मण्यविद्वांसो यथा कुर्वन्ति भारत |        
कुर्याद्विद्वांस्तथासक्तश्चिकीर्षुर्लोकसंग्रहम् ॥**       

**Transliteration:**       
Saktaah karmanyavidvaamso yathaa kurvanti bhaarata |       
Kuryad vidvaamstathaa-saktash chikeershur loka-sangraham ||                 

**Translation:**       
"O Bharata (Arjuna), just as the ignorant act with attachment to work, so should the wise act without attachment, for the welfare of the world."

**Meaning & Explanation:**          
Lord Krishna advises Arjuna that wise individuals should perform their duties selflessly, just as ignorant people perform them with attachment.
However, the difference is that the wise must act without personal attachment and with the intention of maintaining social harmony (loka-sangraham).
This verse emphasizes leading by example—a leader or enlightened person should engage in action to guide others rather than abstaining from duty.
This verse is a call for responsible leadership, aligning with the philosophy of Karma Yoga—acting without selfish motives for the greater good.
