**Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2, Shloka 56 (Sanskrit and Translation):**

**Sanskrit:**                 
दुःखेष्वनुद्विग्नमनाः सुखेषु विगतस्पृहः।      
वीतरागभयक्रोधः स्थितधीर्मुनिरुच्यते।।         

**Transliteration:**          
Duḥkheṣv-anudvigna-manāḥ sukheṣu vigata-spṛhaḥ
Vīta-rāga-bhaya-krodhaḥ sthita-dhīr-munir-ucyate.

**Translation:**        
One whose mind is undisturbed by sorrow, who does not crave for pleasure, and who is free from attachment, fear, and anger, is called a sage of steady wisdom.

**Explanation:**            
This shloka describes the qualities of a person with a steady and composed mind (Sthitaprajna). Such a person remains balanced in all situations, not swayed by sorrow or elated by happiness, and is unaffected by attachments, fears, or anger. It encourages equanimity and detachment from material pleasures and sorrows.
