**The 22nd verse of Chapter 3 (Karma Yoga) of the Bhagavad Gita, spoken by Lord Krishna, states:**      

न मे पार्थास्ति कर्तव्यं त्रिषु लोकेषु किञ्चन।        
नानवाप्तमवाप्तव्यं वर्त एव च कर्मणि॥         

**Transliteration:**                                    
Na me pārthāsti kartavyaṁ triṣu lokeṣu kiñcana,                     
Nānavāptam avāptavyaṁ varta eva ca karmaṇi.                              

**Translation:**                   
O Partha (Arjuna), there is no duty for Me in all the three worlds. There is nothing unattained that I need to achieve, yet I engage in prescribed duties.               

**Explanation:**                           
In this verse, Lord Krishna explains that though He is the Supreme Being and has nothing to gain or achieve, He still performs actions. This serves as an example to humanity, emphasizing the importance of fulfilling one's duties selflessly and without attachment to results. It highlights that even those who are self-sufficient or enlightened must engage in action to guide and inspire others.
