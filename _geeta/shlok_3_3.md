**Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 3, Shloka 3 (3.3):**    

**श्रीभगवानुवाच:**    
**लोकेऽस्मिन द्विविधा निष्ठा पुरा प्रोक्ता मयानघ।**      
**ज्ञानयोगेन सांख्यानां कर्मयोगेन योगिनाम्॥**       

**Transliteration:**    
śrī-bhagavān uvāca       
loke ’smin dvividhā niṣṭhā purā proktā mayānagha       
jñāna-yogena sāṅkhyānāṁ karma-yogena yoginām       

**Translation:**    
**The Blessed Lord said:**        
O sinless one, in this world, two kinds of faith have been declared by Me in the past. For the contemplative and intellectual (Sankhya), the path of knowledge (Jnana Yoga) is suitable, and for the active (Karma Yogi), the path of action (Karma Yoga) is suitable.     

**Explanation:**      
In this verse, Krishna explains the two main spiritual paths that people can follow according to their nature and temperament:

**Jnana Yoga (Path of Knowledge):**        
This is suited for those who are introspective, contemplative, and inclined towards philosophical inquiry. It involves gaining self-knowledge and understanding the ultimate truth.

**Karma Yoga (Path of Action):**      
This is meant for those who are action-oriented and prefer to engage in the world while dedicating their actions selflessly to a higher purpose.

Krishna emphasizes that both paths lead to the same goal of spiritual realization but are designed for different kinds of individuals based on their innate tendencies.
