Here is Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 6, Verse 18 (6.18) in Sanskrit with translation and explanation:

📜 Sanskrit Shloka

यदा विनियतं चित्तम् आत्मन्येवावतिष्ठते ।
निःस्पृहः सर्वकामेभ्यो युक्त इत्युच्यते तदा ॥ १८ ॥

🌍 Transliteration

Yadā viniyataṁ cittam ātmany evāvatiṣṭhate
niḥspṛhaḥ sarva-kāmebhyo yukta ity ucyate tadā

📖 Translation (Simple English)

When the disciplined mind becomes steady and rests in the Self alone, free from all desires for worldly objects, then one is said to be truly united in yoga.

✨ Explanation

- "Viniyatam cittam" – A controlled, well-disciplined mind.    
- "Ātmany evāvatiṣṭhate" – The mind rests firmly in the Self, not wandering outward.    
- "Niḥspṛhaḥ sarva-kāmebhyo" – Free from attraction or longing for all desires.    
- "Yuktaḥ" – Such a person is truly a yogi, in perfect union.    

This verse emphasizes the state of yoga:
Not merely doing meditation as a practice, but reaching a stage where the mind is naturally established in the Self.
It is a condition of desirelessness, self-sufficiency, and inner absorption.
At this point, external attractions no longer disturb the seeker.
