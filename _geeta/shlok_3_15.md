**Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 3, Verse 15 (3.15):**

कर्म ब्रह्मोद्भवं विद्धि ब्रह्माक्षरसमुद्भवम्।        
तस्मात्सर्वगतं ब्रह्म नित्यं यज्ञे प्रतिष्ठितम्॥             

**Transliteration:**       
karma brahmodbhavaṁ viddhi brahmākṣara-samudbhavam               
tasmāt sarvagataṁ brahma nityaṁ yajñe pratiṣṭhitam                                    

**Translation:**                      
"Know that all actions originate from Brahman (the Vedas), and the Vedas come from the imperishable (God or the Absolute Truth). Therefore, the all-pervading Brahman is eternally established in acts of sacrifice."                                

**Explanation:**                     
This verse emphasizes the divine origin and interconnectedness of actions, knowledge, and the eternal principles governing the universe. Actions (karma) are guided by the teachings of the Vedas, which themselves emerge from the eternal, unchanging essence of the divine (Brahman). Hence, sacrificial acts, performed with devotion and in alignment with divine laws, are a medium to connect with the supreme truth and maintain cosmic harmony.                  

This verse highlights the sanctity of performing one's duties selflessly, as prescribed by the divine order.
