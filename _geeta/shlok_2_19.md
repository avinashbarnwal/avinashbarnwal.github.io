Here is verse 2.19 from the Bhagavad Gita:

"Ya enam vetti hantāraṁ yaśh chainaṁ manyate hatam
Ubhau tau na vijānīto nāyaṁ hanti na hanyate."

Translation: He who thinks the soul kills, and he who thinks of it as killed, are both ignorant. The soul kills not, nor is it killed.

Interpretation: In this verse, Lord Krishna emphasizes that the soul is beyond actions such as killing or being killed. Both those who consider themselves the killer and those who think they can be killed misunderstand the true nature of the soul. Since the soul is eternal and imperishable, it transcends all material actions and remains untouched by any act of violence or death in the physical sense. This teaching encourages detachment from the physical actions and results, aligning oneself with the eternal, unchanging nature of the soul.
