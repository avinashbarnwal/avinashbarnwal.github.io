**The Geeta Shlok (Bhagavad Gita 2.69) reads as follows:**

**Sanskrit:**    
या निशा सर्वभूतानां तस्यां जागर्ति संयमी।
यस्यां जाग्रति भूतानि सा निशा पश्यतो मुनेः॥

**Transliteration:**      
Yā niśhā sarva-bhūtānāṁ tasyāṁ jāgarti sanyamī
Yasyāṁ jāgrati bhūtāni sā niśhā paśhyato muneḥ.

**Meaning in English:**      
That which is night to all beings, in that the self-controlled person is awake. The state in which all beings are awake is night to the introspective sage.

**Interpretation:**    
This shloka emphasizes the difference in perception between a spiritually wise individual and ordinary people. The "night" and "day" metaphor reflects contrasting states of awareness:

**For the worldly:**           
They are awake to material pursuits but asleep to spiritual reality.
For the enlightened sage: They are awake to spiritual truth while being indifferent to material attractions.
This verse highlights the inner detachment and higher awareness of a self-realized soul compared to the common worldly outlook.
