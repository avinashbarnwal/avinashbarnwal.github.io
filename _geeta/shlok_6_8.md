Certainly! Here's Bhagavad Gita Chapter 6, Shloka 8 (6.8) with Sanskrit, translation, and explanation:

भगवद् गीता – अध्याय 6, श्लोक 8
Sanskrit:

ज्ञानविज्ञानतृप्तात्मा कूटस्थो विजितेन्द्रियः |
युक्त इत्युच्यते योगी समलोष्टाश्मकाञ्चनः ||
Transliteration:
Jñāna-vijñāna-tṛptātmā kūṭastho vijitendriyaḥ
Yukta ityucyate yogī sama-loṣṭāśma-kāñcanaḥ

English Translation:
"The yogi whose mind is satisfied with knowledge and realization, who is unshakable, has control over the senses, and regards a clod of earth, a stone, and gold as the same — is said to be truly united (yukta)."

Explanation:
This verse describes the qualities of a perfected yogi — someone who is steadfast in yoga and spiritual wisdom.
Jñāna-vijñāna-tṛptātmā: One who is fully content with both theoretical knowledge (jñāna) and direct experiential wisdom (vijñāna).
Kūṭasthaḥ: Unchanging, steady like an anvil — not disturbed by ups and downs.
Vijita-indriyaḥ: One who has conquered the senses.
Sama-loṣṭāśma-kāñcanaḥ: Who sees a lump of earth, a stone, and gold with equal vision — indicating detachment from material possessions and values.
Such a yogi is called "Yukta" — one who is truly united with the Self or Supreme.

Essence:
This shloka teaches us:
The value of inner fulfillment over external possessions
The need for equanimity amidst the material world
That true spiritual success lies in wisdom, self-control, and unshakable steadiness
