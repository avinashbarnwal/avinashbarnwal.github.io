**Here is Bhagavad Gita Chapter 2, Shloka 66 in Sanskrit along with its translation:**

**Sanskrit:**     
नास्ति बुद्धिरयुक्तस्य न चायुक्तस्य भावना।
न चाभावयतः शान्तिरशान्तस्य कुतः सुखम्।।

**Transliteration:**     
Nāsti buddhir-ayuktasya na chāyuktasya bhāvanā,
Na chābhāvayatah śāntir-aśāntasya kutaḥ sukham.

**Meaning:**
For one who is not connected with the Divine (lacking self-control or discipline), there is no wisdom, nor is there meditation (focused awareness). Without meditation, there is no peace; and how can there be happiness for one who lacks peace?

**Commentary:**
This shloka emphasizes the interconnectedness of self-discipline, meditation, inner peace, and happiness. It highlights that a person who lacks self-restraint and focus cannot achieve wisdom or inner tranquility, and without these, true happiness remains elusive. The teaching serves as guidance to cultivate a disciplined and meditative life to attain peace and ultimate joy.
