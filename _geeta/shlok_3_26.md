**Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 3, Verse 26**

**न बुद्धिभेदं जनयेदज्ञानां कर्मसङ्गिनाम् |    
जोषयेत्सर्वकर्माणि विद्वान्युक्तः समाचरन् || ३.२६ ||**

**Transliteration:**     
na buddhi-bhedaṁ janayed ajñānāṁ karma-saṅginām |      
joṣayet sarva-karmāṇi vidvān yuktaḥ samācaran || 3.26 ||      

**Translation:**      
A wise person should not unsettle the minds of the ignorant who are attached to fruitive work. Instead, by performing all duties in a disciplined manner, they should inspire others to engage in action.

**Meaning:**        
Krishna advises that those with wisdom should not disturb those who lack knowledge and are attached to worldly actions. Instead, they should lead by example, performing their duties with dedication while gradually guiding others toward the right path. This highlights the importance of practical leadership and influencing others positively through one's own actions rather than forceful persuasion.
