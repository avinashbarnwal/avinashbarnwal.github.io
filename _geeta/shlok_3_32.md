**Bhagavad Gita Chapter 3, Verse 32 (Shloka 3.32):**          

ये तु द्वेष्यन्ति मम मतं नानुतिष्ठन्ति मे मतः |      
सर्वज्ञानविमूढांस्तान्विद्धि नष्टानचेतसः ||

**Transliteration:**        
ye tu dveṣhyanti mama mataṁ nānutiṣhṭhanti me matāḥ
sarva-jñāna-vimūḍhān tān viddhi naṣhṭān achetasaḥ

**Meaning:**      
But those who, out of envy, do not follow my teachings and disregard my instructions, are deluded in all knowledge and lost in their ignorance. Know them to be ruined in their lack of wisdom.

This verse emphasizes the importance of following divine wisdom and teachings. Those who reject the path of righteousness and wisdom due to arrogance or ignorance remain lost in illusion.
