The shloka 2.55 from the Bhagavad Gita, also known as the verse explaining the qualities of a "sthitaprajna" (a person of steady wisdom), is as follows:

Sanskrit:
श्रीभगवानुवाच
प्रजहाति यदा कामान्सर्वान्पार्थ मनोगतान्।
आत्मन्येवात्मना तुष्टः स्थितप्रज्ञस्तदोच्यते॥

Transliteration:
śrī-bhagavān uvāca
prajahāti yadā kāmān sarvān pārtha manogatān
ātmany evātmanā tuṣṭaḥ sthita-prajñaḥ tadocyate

Translation:
The Supreme Lord said:
"When a person completely renounces all desires of the mind, O Partha (Arjuna), and finds satisfaction in the Self alone, then such a person is said to be of steady wisdom (sthitaprajna)."

Key Meaning:
This shloka describes the characteristics of a self-realized individual. Such a person:

Lets go of all desires that arise from the mind.
Finds inner contentment and fulfillment within their own Self.
Does not depend on external things for happiness.
It emphasizes the ideal of spiritual fulfillment through self-awareness and detachment.
