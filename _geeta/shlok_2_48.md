Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2, Verse 48 (2.48) emphasizes equanimity and the importance of performing one's duties without attachment to success or failure. Here is the verse in Sanskrit with its transliteration and translation:

Sanskrit:
योगस्थः कुरु कर्माणि संगं त्यक्त्वा धनंजय।
सिद्ध्यसिद्ध्योः समो भूत्वा समत्वं योग उच्यते।।

Transliteration:
Yogasthaḥ kuru karmāṇi saṅgaṁ tyaktvā dhanañjaya,
Siddhyasiddhyoḥ samo bhūtvā samatvaṁ yoga ucyate.

Translation:
"Be steadfast in yoga, O Arjuna, perform your duties abandoning attachment, and be the same in success and failure. Such equanimity is called yoga."

Explanation:
Yogasthaḥ: Being established in yoga (the state of mindfulness and spiritual connection).
Kuru karmāṇi: Perform your actions or duties.
Saṅgaṁ tyaktvā: Renouncing attachment.
Siddhyasiddhyoḥ samo bhūtvā: Remaining equal in success and failure.
Samatvaṁ yoga ucyate: This balance of mind is called yoga.
This verse conveys a key teaching of the Bhagavad Gita: focusing on performing one's duties (karma) with a balanced mindset, free from the desire for specific outcomes, embodies true yoga.
