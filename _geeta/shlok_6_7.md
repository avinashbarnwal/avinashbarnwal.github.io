Transliteration
*jitātmanaḥ praśhāntasya paramātmā samāhitaḥ
śītoṣhṇa‑sukha‑duḥkheṣu tathā mānāpamānayoḥ*

Word-by-Word Meaning
jitātmanaḥ – one who has conquered the mind

praśhāntasya – who is deeply peaceful

paramātmā – (for) the Supreme Self or Supersoul

samāhitaḥ – is fixed or established

śītoṣhṇa‑sukha‑duḥkheṣu – in cold and heat, happiness and sorrow

tathā mānāpamānayoḥ – likewise in honour and dishonour 


Translation
"For one who has conquered the mind and is at peace, the Supreme Self is already within reach. Such a person remains undisturbed amid cold and heat, joy and sorrow, honour and dishonour." 


📖 Explanation
In this verse, Krishna describes a yogi whose mind is firmly under control—jitātmanaḥ—and is thus naturally praśhāntaḥ, deeply tranquil. Such serenity allows the yogi to perceive the paramātmā, the Supersoul or Supreme Self, residing within, signifying a state of meditative absorption (samādhi) 

Because the mind is no longer tossed by bipolar experiences—physical discomfort or pleasure (cold/heat), emotional highs and lows (joy/sorrow), or egoic reactions (honour/dishonour)—the yogi remains centered and embodying equanimity.

Commentaries from Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura and Sārārtha‑Varṣiṇī Ṭīkā emphasize that such balance arises from freedom from attachment and aversion, facilitating a mind deeply rooted in samādhi.

🧘‍♂️ Practical Insight
Mind mastery isn’t a lofty ideal—it’s a process of steady practice, self-control, and internal calm.

This verse illuminates the triple-layer of duality that tests our serenity:

Body – physical sensations (heat vs. cold)

Mind – emotional states (happiness vs. sorrow)

Ego – social reactions (honour vs. dishonour)

When fully transcended, these pairs no longer rattle your inner center.
