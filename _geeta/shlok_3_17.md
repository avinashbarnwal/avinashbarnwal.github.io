**Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 3, Verse 17 (3.17)**       

श्लोकः      
यस्त्वात्मरतिरेव स्यादात्मतृप्तश्च मानवः।       
आत्मन्येव च सन्तुष्टस्तस्य कार्यं न विद्यते।।          

**Transliteration:**         
Yastvātmaratir eva syād ātma-tṛiptaśh cha mānavaḥ,         
Ātmanyeva cha santuṣhṭas tasya kāryaṁ na vidyate.         

**Translation:**       
But for one who takes delight in the Self, who is satisfied with the Self, and who is content in the Self alone—for such a person, there is no duty to perform.

**Meaning:**         
This verse emphasizes the state of a spiritually realized person who is completely self-satisfied and content within their own soul. Such a person has transcended worldly desires and attachments. Since they are fulfilled internally, they do not depend on external actions or achievements to find purpose or satisfaction. Consequently, they are free from obligations or duties imposed by society, as they act out of inner harmony rather than necessity.
