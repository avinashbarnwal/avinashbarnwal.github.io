**Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2, Verse 54 (Sanskrit):**     

**अर्जुन उवाच:**       
स्थितप्रज्ञस्य का भाषा समाधिस्थस्य केशव।        
स्थितधीः किं प्रभाषेत किमासीत व्रजेत किम्॥        

**Transliteration:**      
Arjuna uvācha:
Sthitaprajnasya kā bhāṣhā samādhisthasya keśhava.
Sthitadhīḥ kiṁ prabhāṣheta kimāsīta vrajeta kim.

**Translation:**      
Arjuna said: O Keshava (Krishna), what are the characteristics of one who is firmly established in wisdom and absorbed in divine consciousness? How does such a person speak, sit, and walk?
In this verse, Arjuna asks Lord Krishna to describe the traits and behavior of a sthitaprajna—a person who has attained steady wisdom and remains undisturbed by worldly dualities. 
This question leads to a detailed explanation in the following verses about equanimity, self-control, and the qualities of a spiritually enlightened person.
