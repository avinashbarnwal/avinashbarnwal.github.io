Sanskrit:
कार्पण्यदोषोपहतस्वभावः
प्रच्छामि त्वां धर्मसम्मूढचेताः।
यच्छ्रेयः स्यान्निश्‍चितं ब्रूहि तन्‍मे
शिष्यस्‍तेऽहं शाधि मां त्वां प्रपन्नम्।।

Transliteration:
Kārpaṇya-doṣopahata-svabhāvaḥ
Pṛcchāmi tvāṁ dharma-sammūḍha-cetāḥ
Yac chreyaḥ syān niścitaṁ brūhi tan me
Śiṣyas te ’haṁ śādhi māṁ tvāṁ prapannam.

Translation:
"My being is overcome by the weakness of pity, and my mind is confused about my duty. I ask you: what is truly good for me? Tell me decisively. I am your disciple, surrendered to you. Please instruct me."

In this verse, Arjuna surrenders to Krishna, seeking guidance as he is emotionally overwhelmed and unsure about his duty (dharma). Arjuna admits his confusion and helplessness and fully accepts Krishna as his teacher, asking for advice on what path he should follow for his ultimate welfare. This marks a significant moment in the Gita, as Arjuna is now ready to receive Krishna's teachings on life, duty, and spirituality.
