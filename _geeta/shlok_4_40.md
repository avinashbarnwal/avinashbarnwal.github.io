**Shlok : 4 and 40 Verse**

**agyaschashraddadhanasch sanshayatma vinashyati.     
nayam lokoÌ•sti na paro na sukham sanshayatmanah.     ** 

"A person who is ignorant, who lacks faith, and is full of doubt is bound to perish. A doubtful soul finds neither happiness in this world nor in the next. For one who is full of doubts, there is no peace or success."
The verse emphasizes that without knowledge and faith, a person who is filled with doubts cannot succeed.     
Such a person neither attains happiness in this life nor in the afterlife.    
Faith and the pursuit of knowledge are crucial for achieving peace and success, and doubts only lead to downfall.
