**Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 3, Shloka 29 (3.29)**     

श्लोक:
प्रकृतेर्गुणसम्मूढाः सज्जन्ते गुणकर्मसु |     
तानकृत्स्नविदो मन्दान्कृत्स्नविन्न विचालयेत् ||     

**Transliteration:**     
Prakṛiter guṇa-sammūḍhāḥ sajjante guṇa-karmasu |      
tān akṛitsna-vido mandān kṛitsna-vin na vicālayet ||      

**Meaning:**      
Those who are deluded by the modes of material nature become attached to the actions performed by these modes. But a person who has full knowledge should not disturb the ignorant who lack understanding.

**Explanation:**    
People who are under the influence of Prakriti (Nature) and its three Gunas (modes: Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas) get attached to their respective actions.
The wise person, who understands the distinction between the soul and material nature, should not unsettle those who are unaware of this truth.
Instead of disturbing their beliefs or actions, the wise should guide them gradually, allowing them to evolve spiritually.
