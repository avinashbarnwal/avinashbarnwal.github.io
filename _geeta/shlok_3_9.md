**Bhagavad Gita Chapter 3, Verse 9 (Shloka 3.9):**        

यज्ञार्थात्कर्मणोऽन्यत्र लोकोऽयं कर्मबन्धनः।
तदर्थं कर्म कौन्तेय मुक्तसङ्गः समाचर।।

Transliteration:
Yajñārthāt karmaṇo'nyatra loko'yaṁ karmabandhanaḥ
Tadarthaṁ karma kaunteya muktasaṅgaḥ samāchara

**Meaning:**     
Actions performed other than for the purpose of sacrifice (yajña) bind a person in this material world. Therefore, O Arjuna, perform your prescribed duties for the sake of sacrifice, free from attachment.

**Explanation:**    
Krishna emphasizes the importance of performing selfless actions dedicated to a higher purpose (yajña). Actions driven by selfish motives lead to bondage, whereas actions performed with detachment and devotion liberate the soul. This verse encourages fulfilling one's duties as an offering to the divine, free from desires for personal gain.
