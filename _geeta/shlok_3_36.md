In Bhagavad Gita Chapter 3, Verse 36, Arjuna asks Lord Krishna:​


Sanskrit: अर्जुन उवाच |
अथ केन प्रयुक्तोऽयं पापं चरति पूरुषः |
अनिच्छन्नपि वार्ष्णेय बलादिव नियोजितः || ३६||​


Transliteration: arjuna uvāca
atha kena prayukto'yaṁ pāpaṁ carati pūruṣaḥ
anichchhann api vārṣhṇeya balād iva niyojitaḥ​

Translation: Arjuna said: O descendant of Vrishni (Krishna), by what is one impelled to sinful acts, even unwillingly, as if engaged by force? ​

In this verse, Arjuna inquires about the internal force that drives individuals to commit sinful actions against their will, seeking to understand the cause of such behavior.
