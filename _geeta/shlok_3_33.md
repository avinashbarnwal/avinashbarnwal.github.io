**Bhagavad Gita 3.33**

sadr̥śaṁ ceṣṭate svasyāḥ prakr̥ter jñānavān api |
prakr̥tiṁ yānti bhūtāni nigrahaḥ kiṁ kariṣyati ||

**Translation:**    
Even a wise person acts according to their own nature. All beings follow their nature—what can repression accomplish?     

**Meaning:**      
Lord Krishna explains that every individual behaves according to their inherent nature (prakriti). Even a knowledgeable person is bound by their natural tendencies. Since all beings are driven by their innate qualities, merely trying to suppress them forcibly will not be effective. Instead, transformation should come from inner understanding and self-discipline.
