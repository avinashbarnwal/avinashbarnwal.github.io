Here are the verses from the Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2, Verses 27 and 28:

Chapter 2, Verse 27
jātasya hi dhruvo mṛtyur dhruvaṁ janma mṛtasya ca | tasmād aparihārye’rthe na tvaṁ śocitum arhasi ||

Translation:
"For one who has been born, death is certain; and for one who has died, birth is certain. Therefore, you should not grieve over the inevitable."

Chapter 2, Verse 28
avyaktādīni bhūtāni vyakta-madhyāni bhārata | avyakta-nidhanāny eva tatra kā paridevanā ||

Translation:
"All created beings are unmanifested in their beginning, manifested in their interim state, and unmanifested again when annihilated. So what need is there for lamentation?"

These verses emphasize the natural cycle of life and death, encouraging one to accept the inevitable transitions of existence without grief.
