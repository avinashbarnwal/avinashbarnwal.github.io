**Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 3, Verse 7 (3.7):**      

"yas tv indriyāṇi manasā niyamyārabhate ’rjuna         
karmendriyaiḥ karma-yogam asaktaḥ sa viśiṣyate"         

**Translation:**       
But one who controls the senses by the mind, O Arjuna, and engages in karma yoga (selfless action) without attachment, is superior.

**Explanation:**      
Krishna emphasizes the importance of performing one's duties while maintaining self-control and detachment. Instead of renouncing actions, a person who regulates their senses, keeps their mind focused, and works without selfish motives is considered more virtuous and successful in spiritual practice.





This verse highlights the path of karma yoga—the discipline of selfless action—as a means to spiritual growth and liberation.
