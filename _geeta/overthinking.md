Overthinking and Dependencies over others

Below is the Doha by Rahim

amar beli binu muul kii, pratipaalat hai taahi
rahiman aise prabhuhin taji, khojat phirie kaahi

**Meaning:** The poet compares the devotion to God to a vine without roots that still thrives due to the care of the Lord. Rahim advises not to abandon such a benevolent and sustaining God in search of something else, as one will only wander aimlessly.

This doha encourages steadfast faith and reliance on the divine, emphasizing that God sustains us even when we may feel rootless or without direction.
