**arjun uvach
sanyasam karmanam krushna punaryogam ch shansasi .
yachreya etayorekam tanme bruhi sunischitam**     

**Arjuna said:**      
"O Krishna, first you speak of the renunciation of actions, and then you recommend yoga (the path of selfless action). Tell me clearly, which of these two is better?"

**Explanation:**        
In this verse, Arjuna is expressing confusion. Krishna has previously spoken about both sannyāsa (renunciation of actions) and karma-yoga (selfless action through discipline). Arjuna wants to understand which path is ultimately superior. Should one renounce actions completely in pursuit of spiritual progress (sannyāsa), or should one continue to perform actions selflessly and without attachment (karma-yoga)?
Arjuna is essentially asking Krishna to provide a clear and definitive answer about which path leads to a higher state of spiritual advancement, as he is confused about the seeming contradiction between renunciation and action.
This question sets the stage for Lord Krishna’s explanation in the following verses, where he elaborates on the superiority of karma-yoga—the path of selfless action performed with detachment—as a more practical and balanced approach to spiritual life in the world.

**Detailed Explanation**

Arjun was confused about Karm Sanyas vs Karm Yog. Krishna prefers Karm Yog. Ek dusre ko affect kar rahe hain. Prakriti ko left prakriti chala rahi hai.
There are 3 stages:- 
- Aatma Gyan 
- Karm Yog 
- Karm Sanyas 

Directly Karm Sanyas nai jump karna hai. There are demerits to it. It might lead to a situation where kamna puri hoti rahegi aur karm sanyas bhi hota rahega. Kamna ko dekho tab karm sanyas karna hota hai. Order of Importance is Aatma Gyan, Karm Yog and Karm Sanyas. 
Mukti mein prakriti se fight nai karna hota hai. Mukti mein prakriti ke baare mein abhigyanta hai usse fight karna hai. Body se jayada, body ke baare mein bharam hai usse fight karna hai. Karm Yog mein khud le liye nai, situation ke liye karm kiya jata hai.
