**arjun uvach
sanyasam karmanam krushna punaryogam ch shansasi .
yachreya etayorekam tanme bruhi sunischitam**     

**Arjuna said:**      
"O Krishna, first you speak of the renunciation of actions, and then you recommend yoga (the path of selfless action). Tell me clearly, which of these two is better?"

**Explanation:**        
In this verse, Arjuna is expressing confusion. Krishna has previously spoken about both sannyāsa (renunciation of actions) and karma-yoga (selfless action through discipline). Arjuna wants to understand which path is ultimately superior. Should one renounce actions completely in pursuit of spiritual progress (sannyāsa), or should one continue to perform actions selflessly and without attachment (karma-yoga)?
Arjuna is essentially asking Krishna to provide a clear and definitive answer about which path leads to a higher state of spiritual advancement, as he is confused about the seeming contradiction between renunciation and action.
This question sets the stage for Lord Krishna’s explanation in the following verses, where he elaborates on the superiority of karma-yoga—the path of selfless action performed with detachment—as a more practical and balanced approach to spiritual life in the world.
