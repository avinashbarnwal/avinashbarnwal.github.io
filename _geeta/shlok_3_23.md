**The Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 3, Shloka 23 (Bhagavad Gita 3.23) states:**

यदि ह्यहं न वर्तेयं जातु कर्मण्यतन्द्रित:।      
मम वर्त्मानुवर्तन्ते मनुष्याः पार्थ सर्वश:॥    

**Translation:**    
"If I did not engage in action, O Partha (Arjuna), vigilantly at all times, people would follow My path in all respects."

**Explanation:**   
In this verse, Lord Krishna emphasizes the importance of leading by example. He explains that if He Himself were to neglect His duties, others would follow His actions and also abandon their responsibilities. This highlights the concept of Karma Yoga, where even the most enlightened or divine beings continue to perform their prescribed duties for the greater welfare of society.
