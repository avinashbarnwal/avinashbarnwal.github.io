Sanskrit:

श्रेयान् स्वधर्मो विगुणः परधर्मात् स्वनुष्ठितात्।
स्वधर्मे निधनं श्रेयः परधर्मो भयावहः॥

Transliteration:

śhreyān swadharmo viguṇaḥ para-dharmāt sv-anuṣhṭhitāt
swadharme nidhanaṁ śhreyaḥ para-dharmo bhayāvahaḥ

Meaning (English):

It is better to fail in one's own duty (dharma), even if imperfectly performed, than to succeed in the duty of another. Death in the course of one’s own dharma is better; the dharma of another is fraught with fear and danger.

This shloka emphasizes the importance of following one’s own path (dharma)—even if it's difficult or flawed—over imitating someone else's, no matter how perfectly. It teaches authenticity and self-alignment over comparison and imitation.
