**1979 Iranian Revolution:**

- Overthrew the Shah, ending a monarchy that had lasted thousands of years.
- Established a theocratic Islamic Republic led by Ayatollah Khomeini.
- Revolution was fueled by anti-imperialism, with Iran turning against the U.S. and Israel.

**Creation of the "Axis of Resistance":**

- Iran developed a strategy called "forward defense," building a network of allied militias across the Middle East.
- These groups act as Iran's proxies to extend its influence and counter its adversaries, mainly the U.S. and Israel.

  
**Hezbollah (Lebanon):**
- Formed by Iran's Revolutionary Guard in response to Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon.
- Played a major role in forcing Israel to withdraw from Lebanon in 2000.
- Today, it is a powerful political and military force with a large arsenal of rockets aimed at Israel.

**Hamas & Islamic Jihad (Palestine):**
- Both groups oppose Israel and reject peace agreements signed by the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO).
- Hamas, formed during the first Palestinian intifada, and Islamic Jihad both receive political and limited material support from Iran.
- These groups are part of Iran's regional network, with Hamas launching attacks on Israel, including the October 7, 2023 incident.

**Houthis (Yemen):**
- The Houthi movement, inspired by the Iranian Revolution and Hezbollah, grew into a significant force in Yemen.
- In 2015, they captured the Yemeni capital Sanaa and control much of northern Yemen.
- The Houthis have attacked Israeli targets and U.S. interests as part of this broader conflict.

**Hashad al-Shabi (Iraq & Syria):**
- Iran-supported Shia militias that fought against ISIS and are now influential in Iraq and Syria.
- These militias are powerful in Iraq, and continue to target U.S. bases in the region.

**Escalating Conflict:**
- After Hamas' recent attack on Israel, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and other groups began attacking Israel and U.S. interests.
- This has led to retaliatory strikes, escalating tensions between Iranâ€™s Axis of Resistance and Israel and its allies.
