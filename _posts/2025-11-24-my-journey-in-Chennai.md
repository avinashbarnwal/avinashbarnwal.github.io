My Journey in Chennai

Have you ever moved to a new city and felt completely excited… and completely lost at the same time?

I’ve been living in Chennai for the past three and a half years. I had tons of adventurous experiences in Chennai, which I call STARS

- Sightseeing
- Temples
- Aquatics (Swimming)
- Road-learning (Driving)
- Savouring local food
  
I visited several new beaches and temples with my family, and the most fascinating one was the Kapaleeshwarar Temple because of its stunning architecture and the sheer number of people who visit it.

I also visited the aquarium with my family, where the sharks looked huge and intimidating. The underwater world was absolutely stunning, and the slow-moving eel looked surreal.
Swimming is a new love I discovered after learning it recently. Floating in the water feels incredibly relaxing, and I often unwind by going for a swim.

One of the most interesting adventures in Chennai is facing the December floods. The roads fill up with water, and going to the office feels more like a rowing competition. You’re shocked to take an unexpected ‘second bath’ the moment you step outside. You even end up making new friends in the traffic. And when the power goes out, the complete darkness brings back old memories.

I will never forget the New Year’s celebration at Marina Beach. Thousands of people welcomed the year with incredible excitement. It felt like a grand festival, with hundreds of phones lit up the night as everyone captured the moment.
The local snacks here are incredibly tasty. I’ve always been a coffee lover, and discovering karupatti coffee has become a refreshing escape from my regular routine.

In my journey, how can I forget to mention the sportsmanship the city has. It has given me various opportunities to gearup and run on various platforms. I have been participating in 21 km run for past three years and each time seeing 1000s of people all over gives immense joy.
Exploring new places—beaches, temples, and even surviving the floods—gave me experiences that were both challenging and fun. These moments have now become part of my personal list of ‘must-do’ things in life.
