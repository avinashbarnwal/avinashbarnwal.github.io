In "The 5 Types of Wealth," author Sahil Bloom presents a comprehensive guide to achieving a fulfilling life by focusing on five distinct forms of wealth:

- **Time Wealth:** Emphasizes the importance of recognizing time as a finite resource and prioritizing activities that align with personal values, granting individuals the freedom to spend their time meaningfully. 

- **Social Wealth:** Highlights the value of cultivating deep relationships and building a supportive network, which contribute significantly to one's overall well-being and success. 

- **Mental Wealth:** Focuses on maintaining mental health, clarity, and a sense of purpose, enabling continuous personal growth and effective decision-making. 

- **Physical Wealth:** Stresses the importance of health and vitality, advocating for simple principles to enhance physical well-being, which serves as the foundation for all other forms of wealth. 

- **Financial Wealth:** Addresses achieving financial independence and defining one's version of "enough," ensuring that financial resources support, rather than dominate, one's life.
