How should we select goals for 2026? They should be rooted in lifelong lessons. The goals I have set for 2026 are anchored in the lessons outlined below.

Ten Lessons for a Fragile World — Key Ideas

- Ego – Move from trying to beat the market or prove yourself, to supporting your life’s purpose and flowing quietly like a river.      
- Humility – Recognize that everyone is imperfect; seeing others and yourself more generously reduces judgment and conflict.       
- Equanimity – Don’t let life’s ups and downs sweep you off balance; maintain inner peace regardless of external changes (in markets or life).       
- Attention – Treat your attention like a precious asset; avoid “junk scrolling” and notice what truly matters.      
- Freedom – True freedom is the space between stimulus and reaction — the power to choose your response.     
- Questions – Be comfortable living with uncertainty and unresolved questions; trust that profound answers unfold over time.       
- Character – Your values and how you act matter more than external events — remain just and calm in all conditions.       
- Resilience – The ability to think, wait, and fast builds strength; patience and discipline make you difficult to break.      
- Love – Vulnerability and genuine connection (not defensive security) lead to growth and deeper fulfillment.     
- Simple – True peace comes not from accumulating more, but from needing less — embracing patience and contentment (citing Kabir).

# Making 2026 Goals Quantifiable

This framework converts values and lifelong lessons into **measurable, repeatable actions**—without losing depth or meaning.

## 1️⃣ The 3-Layer Quantification Model

For each goal, define:

1. **Behavior Metric** → What I repeatedly do  
2. **Cadence Metric** → How often I do it  
3. **Outcome Check** → How I know it’s working  

> This avoids vanity metrics and focuses on **process + reflection**.
