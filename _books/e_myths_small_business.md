In "The E-Myth Revisited," Michael Gerber emphasizes the importance of defining your Primary Aim as part of building a business that aligns with your life goals.

🎯 What is the “Primary Aim”?
Your Primary Aim is your life’s purpose—what kind of life you want to live—and your business should serve that aim, not distract from it.

✅ Key Questions Under the Primary Aim Section:
Here are the reflective questions Gerber suggests (either explicitly or implicitly) to help you define your Primary Aim:

- What do I value most in life? 
- What kind of person do I want to become? 
- What do I want my life to look like? 
- What do I want to be remembered for? 
- What kind of impact do I want to have on others? 
- How do I define success—personally and professionally? 
- What kind of relationships do I want to nurture? 
- What brings me fulfillment and joy? 
- What would I do if I had unlimited time and money? 
- If today were my last day, would I be satisfied with how I lived?

🧭 Purpose of These Questions:
- To reconnect you to your “why” before building your “what.”
- To ensure your business is not a trap but a vehicle for your personal freedom.
- To help design a business that supports the life you want to live, not one that controls it.
