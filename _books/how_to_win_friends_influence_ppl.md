## SIX WAYS TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE YOU PRINCIPLE 
- Become genuinely interested in other people. 
- Smile. 
- Remember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language. 
- Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves. 
- Talk in terms of the other person’s interests.
- Make the other person feel important—and do it sincerely.

## WIN PEOPLE TO YOUR WAY OF THINKING
- The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it. 
- Show respect for the other person’s opinions. Never say, “You’re wrong.” 
- If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically. 
- Begin in a friendly way.
- Get the other person saying “yes, yes” immediately. 
- Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.
- Try honestly to see things from the other person’s point of view. 
- Be sympathetic with the other person’s ideas and desires.
- Appeal to the nobler motives. 
- Dramatize your ideas. 
- Throw down a challenge.
