# Chapter 7 - Receiving Empathically   

The two parts of NVC: 
1. expressing honestly 
2. 2. receiving empathically

- Empathy: emptying our mind and listening with our whole being.   
- Ask before offering advice or reassurance.   
- Intellectual understanding blocks empathy.   
- No matter what others say, we only hear what they are (1) observing, (2) feeling, (3) needing, and (4) requesting.   
- Listen to what people are needing rather than what they are thinking.   
- When asking for information, first express our own feelings and needs.   
- Reflect back messages that are emotionally charged.   
- Paraphrase only when it contributes to greater compassion and understanding.   
- Behind intimidating messages are merely people appealing to us to meet their needs.   
- A difficult message becomes an opportunity to enrich someone’s life.   
- Paraphrasing saves time.   
- When we stay with empathy, we allow speakers to touch deeper levels of themselves.   
- We know a speaker has received adequate empathy when (1) we sense a release of tension, or (2) the flow of words comes to a halt.   
- We need empathy to give empathy.   



# Chapter 8 - Power of Empathy   
- Empathy allows us “to reperceive [our] world in a new way and to go on.”   
- “Don’t just do something….”   
- It’s harder to empathize with those who appear to possess more power, status, or resources.   
- The more we empathize with the other party, the safer we feel.   
- We “say a lot” by listening for other people’s feelings and needs.   
- Rather than put your “but” in the face of an angry person, empathize.   
- When we listen for feelings and needs, we no longer see people as monsters.   
- It may be difficult to empathize with those who are closest to us.   
- Empathizing with someone’s “no” protects us from taking it personally.   
- To bring a conversation back to life: interrupt with empathy.   
- What bores the listener bores the speaker too.   
- Speakers prefer that listeners interrupt rather than pretend to listen.   
- Empathize with silence by listening for the feelings and needs behind it.   
- Empathy lies in our ability to be present.
